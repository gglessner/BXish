## Dawn -- The Crooked Nail Tavern

The party spent the night at the Crooked Nail in Harrow's End. Aldric prayed over his spells at dawn. Aelindra sat cross-legged by the fire, tracing arcane formulae in her spellbook by candlelight. Same spells as last session.

**Purchases:**

| Item | Cost | Carrier |
|------|------|---------|
| 10-foot pole | 1gp | Varro |
| Torches x6 | 1gp | Aldric |

The 1,000gp in coins and jewellery from Session 1 stay locked in the party's room at the inn.

**Supplies:** 15 torches total. Varro has 9 iron spikes. Rope still spiked at the pit in the dungeon.

---

## Turn 1 -- Return to the Tomb

Midmorning. The party descends the stairs into the tomb. Everything is as they left it -- their bootprints from yesterday still visible in the dust.

At the T-intersection:
- **East:** The spiked door. Two iron spikes wedged at the base. No sound from behind it.
- **West:** The passage to the south cavern (cleared) and the unexplored western chamber.

**Wandering monster check:** d6 = **6.** Clear.

**Light:** Torch #1 (6 turns remaining)

---

## Turn 2 -- The Spiked Door

> **Player:** Send the elf ahead to listen at the door and carefully, slowly and quietly remove the spikes. When she gives the signal the cleric and thief will charge the door and the cleric will turn undead.

Aelindra moves alone to the east passage, soft boots barely whispering on the stone. The others hang back at the T-intersection, out of torchlight range, relying on her infravision.

She presses her ear to the wood.

**Aelindra listens at the door.** (Elf: 2-in-6)
Roll: **1.** Success -- but she hears **nothing.**

Absolute silence. **Undead make no sound.** They could be pressed against the other side of the door or crouched in the far corner. No way to tell.

Aelindra signals the others: *nothing* -- then points at the spikes and mimes pulling them free.

**Quiet spike removal (DEX check, d20-under-15):**
- Spike 1: **8.** She works it free slowly, rocking it side to side. A faint grinding sound. Nothing reacts.
- Spike 2: **11.** Out. She sets both spikes down silently and steps to the side of the doorframe, hand raised.

She looks back down the corridor. Aldric and Varro are waiting in the torchlight, ten paces away. Aldric has his holy symbol in one hand, mace in the other. Varro is behind him with the pole braced.

Aelindra holds up three fingers. Two. One.

She drops her hand.

---

### Aldric Charges

He covers the distance in three strides, shield forward, and slams the door inward with his shoulder. Torchlight floods the burial vault.

The three grey figures are there. Two crouch atop the sarcophagi along the far wall. The third stands in the center of the room, directly over the gnawed remains of the deer carcass, head tilted, hollow eyes fixed on the door. They were waiting. They knew.

Aldric doesn't swing his mace. He raises his holy symbol -- a silver sunburst on a chain -- and speaks a single word that rings off the stone walls like a bell.

**Turn Undead!** (Level 3 Cleric vs Ghoul, needs **7+** on 2d6)
Roll: **9.** **SUCCESS!**

**HD turned:** 2d6 = **7.** Three ghouls = 6 HD total. **All three are turned!**

The effect is immediate and violent. The ghouls shriek -- a keening, glass-on-stone sound that makes Varro's teeth ache. They recoil as if struck, scrambling backward, claws scrabbling on the stone. One throws itself behind a sarcophagus. The other two press into the far corner, clawing at the wall, trying to get *away* from that blazing silver light.

They huddle there, hissing, faces averted. They will not approach while Aldric holds the symbol high.

*"They won't come near me,"* Aldric says through gritted teeth, sweat beading on his forehead. *"But I don't know how long it lasts. Do what you need to do -- quickly."*

---

### The Sarcophagi

The burial vault is 30 feet deep, 20 feet wide. Three open sarcophagi against the far wall. The ghouls are cowering in the northwest corner, as far from Aldric as they can get.

Varro moves fast, checking each sarcophagus. Old bones, remnants of burial shrouds, and --

*"There,"* Varro says. He's already moving, eyes locked on the glint of metal inside the nearest sarcophagus.

**Treasure Found (Treasure Type B):**

| Item | Value | Weight |
|------|-------|--------|
| Silver coins (tarnished, old mint) | 300gp (3,000sp) | 3,000cn |
| Gold coins (Valdros's seal) | 1,000gp | 1,000cn |
| Gold torc with garnet inlay | 900gp | 10cn |
| Silver circlet with moonstones | 600gp | 10cn |

**Total value: 2,800gp** (2,500gp portable, 300gp in heavy silver)

The silver is stacked in the bottom of two sarcophagi -- thousands of coins piled around skeletal remains. Too heavy for what it's worth.

*"The silver's three thousand coins,"* Varro says, weighing a handful. *"That's three thousand coins of dead weight for three hundred gold value. Not worth it unless we make two trips."*

---

## Turn 3 -- The Heist

> **Player:** The thief and elf grab just the gold and jewellery, then exit the room. The cleric backs out last, then the thief spikes the door again.

Varro scoops the gold coins into the satchel. Aelindra pulls the torc from one skeleton's neck and the circlet from another, tucking both into her belt pouch. Neither of them looks at the silver twice.

Thirty seconds. They're done.

Varro jerks his chin toward the door. Aelindra slips out. Varro follows, scooping up the two loose spikes from the floor as he passes the threshold.

*"Aldric. Move."*

The cleric takes one step backward. Then another. Holy symbol blazing in his outstretched fist, eyes locked on the three shapes pressed into the far corner. They watch him with flat, hungry malice -- but they don't move. One opens its mouth. A long, thin hiss.

Aldric clears the doorway. Varro slams the door shut and drops to his knees -- *CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.* -- two spikes driven home under the base.

The hissing stops. Then, from behind the door, a slow scraping. Claws on stone. Coming closer, but stopping short.

*"Same as yesterday,"* Varro says, standing up and dusting off his knees. *"Except now we're richer."*

**Wandering monster check (Turn 2):** d6 = **3.** Clear.

---

**Treasure secured:**

| Item | Value | Weight |
|------|-------|--------|
| Gold coins (Valdros's seal) | 1,000gp | 1,000cn |
| Gold torc with garnet | 900gp | 10cn |
| Silver circlet with moonstones | 600gp | 10cn |

**Total: 2,500gp value, 1,020cn weight**

**Gold split: 334 / 333 / 333 gp**

| Character | Gear | Gold | Jewellery | Total | MV |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Aldric | 850cn | 334cn | -- | **1,184cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Aelindra | 860cn | 333cn | 10cn (torc) | **1,203cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Varro | 655cn | 333cn | 10cn (circlet) | **998cn** | **30'(10')** |

**Varro's spikes:** 7 remaining (2 back in the door)

---

## Turn 4 -- The Exit

> **Player:** We are weighed down again. Let's head back to town and get some rest.

The party moves at familiar pace back through the corridor. They know every flagstone now. No need to probe with the pole.

**Wandering monster check (Turn 4):** d6 = **5.** Clear.

The stairs. Daylight above. Aldric takes the steps two at a time, plate mail ringing. The party emerges into midday sun, squinting. A light rain is falling. The air smells like wet grass and woodsmoke from the village below.

Four turns underground. In and out like professionals.

---

## Afternoon -- Harrow's End

Back at the Crooked Nail. Marda watches the party dump a second load of gold on the table. Her eyes go wide.

*"The tomb?"*

*"Still not cleared,"* Aldric says, lowering himself onto a bench with a groan. *"The things behind the door are still there. We penned them in, took what we could carry, and left."*

*"But the killings--"*

*"We'll go back. But not today."*

### Unfinished Business

The ghouls are penned but alive -- the livestock killings won't stop until they're destroyed. The western chamber is untouched. And Valdros the Pale himself remains undiscovered somewhere deeper in the tomb. Marda is patient, but the village won't wait forever.

But that's a problem for next session. The Crooked Nail has warm ale and a fire.
