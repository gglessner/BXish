# Adventure Session 6 -- The Battle of Greystone Quarry

## Session Summary
The party returns to the Greystone Quarry to eliminate the troglodyte pack terrorizing Thornwall's farms. Day 1: an oil trap at the tunnel mouth kills five troglodytes, but the party withdraws to resupply. That evening they recruit Rodrik (ex-watchman) and gain Durnin's detailed tunnel map. Day 2: armed with hay-stuffed scarecrow decoys on spears, they re-enter the quarry, use psychological warfare, and burn out the remaining troglodytes -- including the pack chief and a clutch of eggs. Nine troglodytes eliminated, quarry cleared. The party refuses Pell's bounty, returns the stolen farm goods, and earns the lasting gratitude of Thornwall.

## Day 1 -- First Assault

### Spells Memorized

- **Aelindra:** Magic Missile
- **Aldric:** Cure Light Wounds, Protection from Evil, Bless, Find Traps

### The Ambush Plan

The party split forces. Varro climbed to the ventilation shaft on the hilltop above the quarry with oil flasks, rocks, and a tinderbox. The rest -- Aelindra, Aldric, and Bron -- descended the ramp to the quarry floor and positioned 30 feet south of the tunnel mouth.

Bron poured two oil flasks across the tunnel threshold -- a glistening slick ten feet wide, covering the entrance. He stepped back with a lit torch in one hand, sword on his hip.

Aelindra raised her hand. Held it. Varro watched from above.

She dropped her hand.

### The Rock Drop

Varro heaved the first stone into the shaft. It crashed and echoed -- **CRACK, CRACK, BOOM** -- bouncing off the walls all the way down. He kept dropping. A steady rain of granite, the noise enormous in the quarry.

From the tunnel mouth: clicking. Rapid, sharp, like claws on slate. Hissing. Guttural barking in a language that wasn't language. Getting louder.

### They Come

Five troglodytes burst from the tunnel at a run. Low, hunched, muscular -- mottled grey-green skin shifting color as they moved from dark stone to daylight. Wide flat heads, yellow eyes squinting against the sun, needle teeth, clawed hands. They stank like a swamp rotting in summer.

They were panicked by the rockfall. They hadn't seen the party. They hadn't seen the oil.

The first two hit the slick and went down hard -- one flat on its back, the other catching itself on all fours in the oil. The three behind slammed into them, stumbling, sliding, a pile of thrashing reptile bodies on the oiled stone.

### Surprise Round -- Party Acts

**Bron** hurled the torch. It tumbled end over end and landed in the oil with a soft *whump*. The fire bloomed -- a sheet of orange flame across the tunnel mouth. Four troglodytes were caught in it. Two never got up. Two clawed their way forward through the flames, trailing fire, burned but alive.

**Aelindra** targeted the fifth -- the one that had stumbled past the oil. A bolt of silver light streaked from her fingers.

*Magic Missile: 1d6+1 = 6. Trog C: 2/8 hp.*

**Aldric** spoke a prayer. Protection from Evil settled over him -- evil creatures attack at -1, saves at +1. Duration: 6 turns.

### Round 2

*Initiative: Party 4, Troglodytes 3.*

**Varro** lit an oil flask and dropped it down the ventilation shaft. Fire erupted at the bottom -- the shaft was sealed. Shrieking from below as a troglodyte near the shaft base caught the blast. Varro left his position and started moving toward the quarry rim above the tunnel entrance.

**Aelindra** drew her longbow and put an arrow into the largest troglodyte crawling out of the fire.

*d20 = 16 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d6 = 4. Trog A: 2/6 hp.*

**Aldric** whipped a stone from his sling at the other burning troglodyte.

*d20 = 11 vs AC 5. Miss.*

**Bron** held position, sword ready.

The troglodytes charged. **Trog C** rushed Bron -- he'd been waiting for exactly this. His sword came down in a clean arc.

*Held attack: d20 = 18 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d8+1 = 7. Trog C killed.*

**Trog A** reached Aelindra before she could drop the bow. A claw tore across her forearm. Teeth closed on her shoulder before she twisted free.

*Claw: d20 = 14. Hit. 1d4 = 2. Bite: d20 = 17. Hit. 1d4 = 3. Aelindra took 5 damage: 7/12 hp.*

**Trog B** threw itself at Aldric. Every strike slid wide -- claws skidding off something invisible. The Protection from Evil turned the attacks like a shield.

*All three attacks missed against effective AC 3.*

### Round 3

*Initiative: Party 6, Troglodytes 2.*

**Bron** saw the blood on Aelindra's arm. Three strides. Sword high. One downward cut.

*d20 = 13 +1(STR) = 14 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d8+1 = 6. Trog A killed.*

**Aldric** dropped the sling, pulled his mace, and brought it down.

*d20 = 17 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d6 = 4. Trog B killed.*

All five exterior troglodytes dead.

From deep inside the tunnel -- silence. Then the sound of something heavy growling and the clicking stopped. Whatever was arguing in there had reached a decision.

### Round 4

**Varro** reached the quarry rim directly above the tunnel mouth. The fire below was dying. He dropped a fresh oil flask into the embers. The tunnel mouth erupted again -- fresh flames filling the entrance.

*Varro's oil remaining: 2 flasks.*

**Aldric** knelt beside Aelindra and healed her.

*Cure Light Wounds: 1d6+1 = 5. Aelindra: 12/12 hp.*

### The Withdrawal

The clicking from inside had gone silent. The shaft fire was dying. Two oil flasks wouldn't last forever, and the tunnels were the troglodytes' home ground -- their skin shifted color to match stone, giving them ambush advantage in the dark.

Varro whistled the rally signal -- two sharp notes across the quarry. The party backed away from the tunnel mouth, climbed the ramp, regrouped at the rim, and withdrew.

*Encounter check (road to Thornwall): d6 = 4. Clear.*

They reached Thornwall's south gate as the sun touched the treetops.

---

## Evening in Thornwall

### Resupply

Old Harwick was pulling shutters closed when the party arrived, soot-streaked and stinking of oil smoke. He opened the door without a word.

| Item | Quantity | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Oil flask | 10 | 20 gp |
| Torches (bundles of 6) | 2 | 2 gp |

Split between Bron and Varro -- 5 oil flasks and 6 torches each.

### Report to Pell

Pell was at the Ironwater Inn, same corner table. He stood so fast he knocked his chair over when the party walked in.

*"Five. You killed five of them."* He sat back down slowly. *"And you're going back?"*

When the party asked about extra help, Pell pointed them to two men.

### Durnin -- The Map

**Durnin** sat at the end of the bar. Grey beard, bad knee, drinking alone. Twenty-three years as foreman at Greystone Quarry. Two years telling anyone who'd listen that something had moved into his tunnels. Nobody believed him.

Aelindra sat across from him, bought him a hot meal, and told him what they'd found. Five troglodytes dead. More inside. The stench. The skin that shifted color.

His hand was shaking. *"Twenty-three years I worked those cuts. Two years I've been telling people something moved in."* His voice cracked. *"They laughed."*

Between bites of the first hot meal anyone had bought him in a long time, he drew the tunnels from memory. First in spilled ale on the table, then properly on parchment:

```
                    [Ventilation Shaft -- up to hilltop]
                              |
  [Main Entrance] ---60'--- [Primary Chamber 40x60, pillared]
                              |            |
                         [North Cut]   [South Ramp -- slopes DOWN 20']
                         (dead end)        |
                                     [DEEP CUTS -- lower level]
                                      / | | \
                              (branching tunnels -- 3 to 4 passages)
                                        |
                              [Drainage Channel -- east hillside]
                              (3' wide, 2' tall, iron grate, 20 years old)
```

He marked where the ceiling dropped to six feet, where the pillars stood in the primary chamber, the ramp angle to the deep cuts, and the drainage channel exit on the east hillside. Every detail from twenty-three years of quarry work.

*"Kill every last one of them. That quarry was my life's work."*

Aelindra paid him 10 gold. *"You may have just saved our lives."*

### Rodrik -- The Spear

**Rodrik** sat near the fireplace. Ex-watchman, big as a door frame, sacked when Alderman Crake cut the patrol budget. Between odd jobs hauling grain.

**Aldric** walked over. CHA 16 -- the highest in the party.

*"Wow, you are big. Big enough and brave enough to kill lizard men? ...if the price is right?"*

*Reaction roll: 2d6 +1(CHA) +1(good offer) = 11. Accepted.*

Rodrik demanded an equal share -- not a half-share, not a quarter. Same tunnels, same teeth, same cut. One condition: he walks in knowing the plan.

Aldric sweetened the deal: *"Out of respect, I'll add this. If there is no treasure down there, we'll pay you 100 gold for the trouble. ...but I get a feeling you will be happy and want your equal share instead."*

Rodrik's expression shifted. *"You know what that tells me? It tells me you've done this before and the people who fought beside you didn't get cheated."*

**Rodrik -- Retainer (Fighter 1)**

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | 6 |
| AC | 4 (chainmail + shield) |
| Weapons | Spear (1d6), short sword (1d6) |
| THAC0 | 19 |
| Morale | 9 (Aldric's CHA loyalty base) |

---

## Day 2 -- The Scarecrow Assault

### Morning Preparations

Before heading to the quarry, the party made three unusual stops:

| Shop | Items | Cost |
|------|-------|------|
| Clothier | 3 shirts, 3 trousers, 3 cloaks | 12 gp |
| Weaponsmith | 3 spears | 3 gp |
| Stables | 1 bale of hay | 5 sp |

Rodrik watched all of this from the gate. Shirts. Pants. Cloaks. Spears. Hay. He opened his mouth, thought better of it, and closed it.

*"I'm not going to ask,"* he said to Bron on the road.

*"Smart."*

### Arrival at the Quarry

Three hours south. The quarry was the same -- except the five troglodyte bodies from Day 1 were gone. Dragged back inside. Only the oil burn marks remained.

They'd been busy. They knew the party was coming.

### Building the Scarecrows

Varro unveiled the plan: *"What they won't be expecting are scarecrows covered in flammable oil, hanging from the end of a spear. When they attack -- and they will attack -- we safely stab at them from behind the scarecrow and light them up with a torch. They won't fall for it more than once, so we are doing all three at the same time!"*

Twenty minutes of work. Each scarecrow: a thick bundle of hay stuffed into shirt and trousers, cinched with rope, cloak over the top, spear running up through the center as a spine. Two oil flasks soaked into each one.

They were ugly. They were lopsided. They were perfect.

**Oil allocation:**

| Use | Flasks |
|-----|--------|
| Scarecrow 1 (Rodrik) | 2 |
| Scarecrow 2 (Bron) | 2 |
| Scarecrow 3 (Aelindra) | 2 |
| Varro -- shaft diversion | 1 |
| Reserve | 5 |

**Formation:**

```
    TUNNEL WALLS
    |                        |
    | [Rodrik]  [Bron]  [Elf]|    <-- scarecrows on spears, oil-soaked
    |                        |
    |      [Aldric]          |    <-- two torches, backlighting
    |                        |
    |      [Varro]           |    <-- rear guard (joining after shaft job)
    |                        |
    TUNNEL WALLS
```

The torches behind would backlight the scarecrows, making them harder to distinguish from real people. The cleric held one torch for light, one for ignition.

### Varro's Diversion

Varro climbed to the ventilation shaft with one oil flask, tinderbox, and a pocket full of pebbles.

*Tink... tink... tink...* Pebbles down the shaft. Nothing. Bigger pebble: *CRACK... CRACK... CRACK.*

Scraping from below. Something moving toward the shaft. A low, wet hiss.

Varro lit the flask, counted to two, and dropped it. **WHOMP.** Shrieking from below. Claws scrabbling away from flames. The heavy growl of something big giving orders.

He didn't wait. Already running back along the hilltop toward the ramp.

### The March In

The scarecrow team entered the tunnel. Then the noise started.

**STOMP. STOMP. STOMP.**

Six pairs of boots hammering stone. Bron let out a snarl that sounded genuinely inhuman. Rodrik barked like a war dog. Aelindra howled. Aldric roared. Varro banged his dagger pommel against the tunnel wall: **CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.**

The noise was enormous in the confined space. It sounded like twenty men. The scarecrow shadows stretched forward in the torchlight -- three huge, swaying shapes advancing. From the front, in the dark, they'd look monstrous.

Sixty feet of stomping, howling, and growling. The tunnel widened. The ceiling rose.

### The Primary Chamber

Torchlight flooded the room. Forty by sixty feet, six thick pillars, bones and filth on the floor. Durnin's map was perfect.

The party stomped in. Scarecrows forward. Torches blazing. Howling.

Nothing moved.

Then three of them came at once. From behind three different pillars. Grey-green blurs that were stone a heartbeat ago. Two hit the scarecrows -- claws ripping through cloth, tearing into hay, jaws clamping on the cloak. Finding nothing but dry grass.

The chief -- the big one -- was smarter. It came low, under Bron's scarecrow, reaching for his legs.

A fourth dropped from behind the nearest pillar, flanking toward Aldric and the torchlight.

### Scarecrow Combat -- Round 1

*Initiative: Party 5, Troglodytes 3.*

The cleric yelled: **"Okay now!"**

**Rodrik** drove his spear straight through the scarecrow and into the troglodyte tangled in it.

*d20 = 14 (12+2 advantage) vs AC 5. Hit. 1d6 = 5. Trog E: 3/8 hp.*

**Aelindra** rammed her spear through her scarecrow. *"How about some fire, scarecrow!"*

*d20 = 18 (16+2 advantage) vs AC 5. Hit. 1d6 = 4. Trog D: 1/5 hp.*

**Bron** thrust downward at the chief going under his guard. The chief rolled sideways -- fast -- and the spear sparked off stone.

*d20 = 12 vs AC 5. Miss.*

**Aldric** pressed both torches into the oil-soaked scarecrows.

Three oil-soaked hay bundles ignited simultaneously. The sound was a deep, chest-thumping **WHUMP** and then a roar. Six feet of rolling orange flame. Burning straw flying everywhere.

*Trog D (1 hp): fire 1d8 = 3. Dead.*
*Trog E (3 hp): fire 1d8 = 6. Dead.*
*Chief (under Bron's scarecrow): partial fire 1d4 = 3. 12/15 hp.*

Two burned alive in the scarecrow trap. The chief scrambled backward, trailing smoke.

### The Break

The chief staggered to its feet. Bigger than the others -- a head taller, scarred across the snout. It saw two of its pack burning on spear-tips, the entrance full of fire and screaming figures. Trog F froze mid-charge toward Aldric.

*Morale check (50% casualties): 2d6 = 11 vs ML 9. FAIL.*

Both broke. Turned and ran south -- toward the ramp to the deep cuts. Two grey-green shapes disappearing into the dark.

### The Chase

*"I see the big one!"* Aelindra shouted. Troglodytes are cold-blooded -- nearly invisible to infravision against cool stone. But the chief had taken burning oil across its back. Its hide was still smoking, a bright smear of warmth against the cold granite.

The party ran. Bron fell behind in plate mail -- 60-foot movement against the troglodytes' 120. The gap widened.

Aelindra stopped on the ramp, raised her hand, and let the spell go.

*Magic Missile: auto-hit. 1d6+1 = 5. Chief: 7/15 hp.*

The silver bolt hit the chief between the shoulder blades. It staggered, howled, and turned a corner. The heat signature vanished.

### The Deep Cuts -- Junction

The ramp leveled out into the lower level. Heavy, damp air. Three passages branched from a crossroads:

- **West:** Narrow, curved left, no signs of use
- **South:** Wider, straight, tool marks, strongest stench
- **East:** Sloped down, wet floor, steady dripping

**Aldric** cast Bless on the party. +1 to attack rolls, 6 turns.

*Aldric's remaining spells: CLW, Protection from Evil, Find Traps.*

**Varro** crouched low and scanned the stone floor. Ten seconds. *"Here."* Dark ichor spots -- almost black, thick, viscous. The magic missile had hit the chief in the back. It was leaking.

The blood trail led **south**. The other troglodyte -- uninjured, no blood -- could have gone anywhere.

### The Lair

The party followed the trail south. Bron leading, sword out, scanning every surface. Fifty feet of passage, tool marks giving way to rougher stone, the stench building to a wall.

The passage opened into a low, wide chamber. Thirty feet across, irregular, ceiling sagging to five feet in places. Gnawed livestock bones, torn hides, broken farm tools, nesting material in the far corner.

Bron took one step in. Scanned left. Almost missed it.

A single drop of dark ichor slid down the wall to his left. Two feet from his shoulder. Rolling slowly down what looked like bare granite.

Stone walls don't bleed.

His eyes tracked up. A ridge that didn't belong. A line of scales pressed flat against the rock. The faint gleam of a yellow eye opening.

*"Here he is!"*

*Bron's attack: d20 = 14 +1(STR) +1(Bless) = 16 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d8+1 = 8. Chief (7 hp) killed.*

The sword took it across the neck. The camouflage died with it -- grey stone rippled to mottled green as the chief slid down the wall.

**Lair treasure:**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| 3,000 silver pieces | 300 gp equivalent |
| Smoky quartz | 10 gp |
| 2 jasper stones | 50 gp each |
| Carnelian | 100 gp |
| Banded agate | 100 gp |
| Tiger eye | 100 gp |
| Garnet | 500 gp |
| **Total** | **1,210 gp** |

Also found: Pell's branded leather halter, a milking stool, and a child's wooden toy horse. Stolen from the farms.

### The Drainage Grate

The party backtracked to the junction and headed east. The passage narrowed, ceiling dropping, floor wet with standing water. Single file -- Bron's plate mail scraping both walls.

Twenty feet ahead: frantic scraping. Metal on stone. The last troglodyte was clawing at Durnin's twenty-year-old drainage grate. Two bars bent, but the frame held.

It heard the boots and spun. Torchlight hit it full in the face. Cornered. Alone. Its skin flickered -- grey, green, grey -- cycling through colors.

*Morale check: 2d6 = 10 vs ML 9. Fail.*

Its claws dropped. The hissing faded to rapid, clicking breaths. It pressed against the grate, watching Bron with the flat stare of something that knew it was dead.

Varro took out an oil flask, lit it, and threw. *"You know, I almost feel sorry for this one."*

*Oil flask: d20 = 16 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d8 = 6. Trog F: 6/12 hp. Burning.*

Aldric's sling stone cracked its ribs.

*Sling: d20 = 17 vs AC 5. Hit. 1d4 = 3. Trog F: 3/12 hp.*

Aelindra's arrow sparked off the grate. Miss.

The fire finished it. It slid down the iron bars and didn't get up.

*Fire damage: 1d8 = 5. Trog F: dead.*

Through the grate, afternoon sun shone on green grass.

### The Eggs

Aldric insisted on checking the west passage. *"We don't want to overlook the possibility of a clutch of lizard men eggs!"*

The passage was narrow -- five feet, curving left, thirty feet to a dead-end alcove. The air was warmer here. A thermal vent in the stone floor, carrying heat from deep below.

Five eggs. Each the size of a large goose egg, leathery grey-green shells. Warm to the touch. The thermal vent had been incubating them.

Aldric looked at the party. *"I take no pleasure in this."*

He said a prayer. Then stomped each one.

*"Evil must be eradicated."*

### Exit

The party collected the treasure, gathered the stolen farm goods, and Bron severed the chief's claw for proof. They climbed back through the deep cuts, up the ramp, through the scorched primary chamber, and out into daylight.

The mule was exactly where they'd left it, chewing grass.

---

## Return to Thornwall

*Encounter check: d6 = 2.*

An hour from town, a farmer mending a fence post saw the party pass -- bloodied weapons, soot-stained armor, cart from the quarry road. He dropped his hammer and ran to tell the neighbors. Word outran the party. By the time they reached the south gate, the guards were grinning.

### The Bank

Five equal shares.

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Aelindra | 242 gp |
| Varro | 242 gp |
| Aldric | 242 gp |
| Bron | 242 gp |
| Rodrik | 242 gp (new account opened) |

Rodrik stared at the number in the ledger. Two hundred and forty-two gold. He was hauling grain last week.

### Pell

They found him at the Ironwater. Bron set the chief's claw on the table.

*"All of them?"*

*"All of them. Nine adults and a clutch of eggs. The quarry is clear."*

Aelindra set down the branded halter, the milking stool, and the child's wooden toy horse.

Pell picked up the toy. His hand was shaking. *"This was my girl's. She cried for a week when we couldn't find it."*

He reached for his coin purse. *"A hundred gold, like I said--"*

Aldric put a hand on his arm.

*"My god blesses the town. Those evil creatures will not be back."*

The common room went quiet. Pell sat down slowly, holding his daughter's toy horse, looking at a cleric who had just cleared a monster-infested quarry and wouldn't take a copper for it.

*"I don't..."* He cleared his throat. Wiped his eyes. *"You need anything in this town -- anything, ever -- you come to me first."*

Three more farmers came in to shake hands. The barkeep refused to let the party pay for ale.

### Durnin

Aelindra pulled up a chair beside the old quarry foreman and called for another hot meal. Then she told him the whole story.

His eyes went wide at the oil trap. He leaned forward at the scarecrows. *"You stuffed clothes with hay?"*

*"On spears. Soaked in oil."*

*"And they attacked them?"*

*"Claws full of straw."*

She told him about the chief, pressed flat against the wall, camouflaged, two feet from Bron. How the ichor dripping down what should have been bare stone gave it away.

*"If your map hadn't told us exactly where the lair was, we'd have walked into that blind."*

She told him about the drainage grate. *"The grate held?"* he asked. *"The grate held."*

Something moved across his face that he didn't quite manage to hide.

She told him about the eggs, the thermal vent, the cleric's prayer.

Then she leaned back, took a drink, and grinned.

*"...and then I said, 'how about some fire, scarecrow!'"*

Durnin laughed. Deep, rough, the kind that comes from a place that hasn't been used in a while. It turned into a cough. He waved it off, eyes wet.

*"You're mad. The lot of you."* He wiped his face with a calloused hand. *"And those tunnels -- my tunnels -- they're clean?"*

*"Every passage. Every cut. We checked them all."*

He stared at his stew for a long time.

*"Twenty-three years I built that place. Two years I tried to tell people something was wrong in it. Nobody listened. You did."*

He reached across the table and squeezed her hand once. Quick. Rough. Then pulled back and picked up his spoon like nothing happened.

*"Now let me eat my damn stew before it gets cold."*

### Rodrik

Across the common room, Rodrik was telling his version of the story to a table of increasingly wide-eyed locals. Each retelling added another ten troglodytes.

When Aldric caught his eye, Rodrik raised his mug. The cleric had told him: *"If there's no treasure, we'll pay you 100 gold for the trouble."*

Rodrik looked at the memory of 242 gold pieces in his new bank account and grinned.

*"I picked the right job."*

## Open Hooks

- **The Riders:** Three people (dark-haired woman with angular silver brooch, armored man who didn't speak, pale thin man who didn't eat or drink) asking about the party's cleric. Headed west toward Harrow's End. Identity and motive unknown.
- **Bandit Bounty:** 25 gp per head, forest road north of Thornwall. Watch stretched thin.
- **Sefton's Wine Escort:** 60 gp to Kingsbridge, 4 days on the bandit-plagued forest road.
- **Alderman Crake:** Unpopular tax collector. Cut the watch budget (cost Rodrik his job). Merchants avoiding toll roads.
- **Greystone Quarry:** Cleared. Durnin's life work reclaimed. Potential for the town to reopen the quarry.
- **Kael's Group:** Departed west. Iron token at the Ironwater for future contact. Work the Thornwall-Kingsbridge-border triangle.
- **Merik's Warning:** Riders asking about the party, heading toward Harrow's End. The dark-haired woman wore a silver brooch shaped like a key or lockpick.
