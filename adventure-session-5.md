# Adventure Session 5 -- The Road to Thornwall and the Greystone Quarry

## Session Summary
After clearing the tomb of undead and donating the silver hoard to Harrow's End, the party recruits Bron permanently, purchases mules and carts to transport their gold, and travels east to Thornwall. Along the way they encounter and hire a band of adventurers as escorts, learn that mysterious riders have been asking about them, deposit their wealth in a bank, go shopping, gather intelligence about a creature terrorizing local farms, and march south to the Greystone Quarry. The session ends at the quarry rim with three hours of daylight remaining.

## Morning in Harrow's End

### Spells Memorized

- **Aelindra:** Sleep, Magic Missile (L1); Mirror Image (L2)
- **Aldric:** Cure Light Wounds, Detect Magic (L1); Bless, Find Traps (L2)

### Bron's Decision

Varro found Bron out behind the inn, sitting on a fence rail, looking at nothing in particular. Edric's hatchet was across his knees. He didn't look up right away.

The thief pulled him aside. *"You okay? What's in the future for you? Settle down with a wife here in town? ...or do you seek the life of adventure with us?"*

Bron was quiet for a long time. He turned the hatchet over in his hands.

*"Edric was the one who was supposed to leave. He talked about it all the time. Seeing the coast. Signing on with a merchant company. He had plans."*

He set the hatchet down on the rail beside him.

*"I was the one who was going to stay. Fix the fence. Marry Tilda. Help my uncle with the timber."*

He looked at Varro.

*"But I've been in that tomb five times now. I've thrown fire at things that shouldn't exist. I watched your cleric make the dead cower with a word. I carried gold I couldn't have earned in ten years of cutting wood."*

He picked up the hatchet again.

*"Edric would have gone with you in a heartbeat. I think... I think I owe him that."*

**Loyalty check (2d6 vs Loyalty 7):** 2d6 = **5.** He stays.

*"I'm not settling down. Not yet. If you'll still have me."*

He looked back toward the hill.

*"Besides. Somebody should carry his hatchet somewhere worth carrying it."*

**Bron remains with the party as retainer. Quarter share, Loyalty 7.**

### The Gold Problem

The party asked around for four horses with saddlebags. Harrow's End is a timber village with maybe forty souls -- the livestock situation reflected that.

Marda sent them to Old Garrett, who kept the largest farm on the south end. He scratched his beard and took stock:

| Animal | Available | Price | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Draft horse | 2 | 40gp each | Sturdy, not fast. Used to pulling logs |
| Mule | 2 | 30gp each | Surefooted, stubborn, reliable |
| Riding horse | 0 | -- | Nobody in Harrow's End owns one |

*"That's what I can sell without crippling my spring planting. You want proper riding horses, you'll need Thornwall."*

The real problem was weight. The party was carrying roughly 9,000 gold pieces -- about 900 pounds of metal. Even split across four animals with riders and gear, that was over 200 pounds of gold per mount. A heavy, slow party on a known road with saddlebags bulging was exactly the kind of thing that attracted attention.

The party asked about carts instead. Two mules pulling two carts could handle the bulk -- a cart holds roughly 4,000 coins of cargo, so two carts handled 8,000 coins. If each party member carried their own armor, weapons, and a share of gold on their person, the carts managed the rest easily.

Garrett had one sturdy two-wheeler. The village carpenter Pel had a lighter cart he'd built for hauling shingles -- narrower but roadworthy.

**Purchases in Harrow's End:**

| Seller | Item | Price |
|--------|------|-------|
| Garrett | Mule x2 | 60gp |
| Garrett | Cart (heavy, 2-wheel) | 80gp |
| Pel | Cart (light, 2-wheel) | 60gp |
| Henk | Rations, 1 week x4 | 20gp |
| Henk | Waterskins x4 | 4gp |
| Henk | Torches x12 | 2gp |
| Henk | Bedrolls x4 | 4gp |
| | **Total** | **230gp** |

**Loading the carts:**
- Heavy cart: bulk of the gold, iron spikes, extra torches, oil, rations
- Light cart: remainder of gold, bedrolls, waterskins, personal packs
- Each party member walked alongside carrying their own weapons, armor, and a day's rations

**Party gold after purchase:** ~9,030gp

## Departure from Harrow's End

Early afternoon. The sky was grey but dry. Marda stood at the edge of the village with a few others. She pressed a cloth bundle into Aldric's hands -- bread and salted pork for the road.

*"Thornwall's two days east. Stay on the river road and you won't miss it. There's a stone bridge halfway -- good place to camp if you don't want to sleep in the open."*

She looked at Bron.

*"You come back and visit, you hear me?"*

Bron nodded. He didn't look back as the party headed east.

## Day 1 -- The River Road

**Wilderness encounter check:** d6 = **4.** Clear.

The road followed the river downstream through rolling hills and thin woodland. Mule pace was steady. The carts creaked and rattled over packed dirt. Birds. Wind. The smell of cold water.

Cart tracks, hoofprints, old wheel ruts filled with rainwater. Other people used this road -- not many, but enough to keep the brush from swallowing it. The river ran to the left, grey-green and fast with snowmelt. Thin woodland on the right, mostly birch and scrub oak, bare branches against a white sky. Occasionally they passed a charcoal-burner's clearing or an old stone mile marker so weathered the numbers were illegible.

Midday, Aelindra spotted chimney smoke from a farmstead set back from the road. A dog barked but nobody came out. The mules plodded on.

### Evening -- The Stone Bridge

Late afternoon. The road dipped and the river narrowed. Ahead: a single-arch stone bridge, old and solid, with moss climbing the abutments. On the near side, a flat area of trampled grass where travelers had camped before -- a fire ring of blackened stones, a few discarded tin cups, an old rope tied to a tree near the water.

On the far side of the bridge, the road continued east into thicker woodland. Fresh ruts in the mud -- a wagon had crossed here within the last day or two, heading toward Thornwall.

The party camped at the bridge. The carts were tucked under the near abutment where the bank was dry and flat -- from the road, all anyone would see was a campfire and four travelers bedding down. No cargo visible. The mules were hobbled nearby with access to water and grass.

The fire crackled. Rations heated on flat stones tasted better than they had any right to. The river murmured under the bridge. Bron ate quietly, Edric's hatchet on his knee. Each person took a two-hour watch while the others slept.

### The Night

**Night encounter check:** d6 = **5.** Clear.

One moment worth noting: during the small hours, the sentry heard hoofbeats on the road -- coming from the east, moving fast, heading west toward Harrow's End. Two riders, maybe three. They didn't slow at the bridge. Torchlight bobbed and vanished into the dark. Whoever they were, they were in a hurry and they didn't stop.

Dawn came grey and cold. Frost on the grass. Mules fine. Carts undisturbed.

---

## Day 2 -- Toward Thornwall

Back on the road after a cold breakfast. The woodland thickened. The river widened again. More signs of civilization -- a woodcutter's stump with fresh chips, a stone wall marking someone's pasture, sheep dotting a hillside.

**Wilderness encounter check:** d6 = **1.** Encounter.

### The Encounter

Mid-morning. Aelindra raised a fist. Ahead on the road, maybe 80 yards out: four figures and a laden pack mule, heading toward them -- coming *from* Thornwall.

As they closed, the party could make them out. Armed. Armored. Not soldiers -- no uniforms. A tall woman in chain with a two-handed sword across her back. A wiry man with a shortbow and a quiver. A stocky, bearded figure in plate -- dwarf. And a fourth in robes with a walking staff, hood up.

They'd seen the party too. The woman in front had slowed. Her hand hadn't gone to her weapon, but she was sizing up the group -- two carts, four walkers, armed. The dwarf rested a gauntleted hand on his belt. The archer had drifted to the roadside -- not threatening, just positioning. Professional.

Both parties were aware. No surprise possible.

### Hiring Kael's Group

Aelindra advanced ahead of the carts to greet them with a smile.

*"Are you coming from Thornwall? We are trying to get there before we encounter bad weather. Any chance you would want to make sure we arrive there safely? We can pay."*

**Reaction roll (2d6):** **8.** Neutral -- uncertain, willing to talk.

The woman tilted her head.

*"Thornwall's half a day ahead. The road's been quiet -- quieter than usual, honestly."*

She glanced at the carts.

*"We're heading west. Got a lead on something past the river fork."* A pause. *"Escort work wasn't the plan."*

The robed figure pushed back his hood -- a young man, sharp-featured, with ink stains on his fingers. He spoke up before the woman could continue.

*"How much is 'pay'?"*

The woman gave him a look. He shrugged.

*"We've been walking since dawn, Kael. I'm just asking what the elf is offering."*

The dwarf said nothing. He was watching the tree line, not the conversation.

The woman -- Kael, apparently -- turned back to Aelindra.

*"Half a day's work to walk you in. What are you carrying that needs an escort on a settled road?"*

Aelindra nodded to the cleric, who nodded back. *"That man is a powerful cleric who can call down the power of his god from the heavens in ways I have never seen before. He can destroy armies. Thankfully he has a good heart and is travelling with us, but we don't want to take any chances. Would 100 gold each be enough to cover your trouble to escort us and the holy man to Thornwall? We could pay half now and the other half if we arrive safely. Just escort us to the nearest bank, then the inn and we can let you get back to your adventures. Is it a deal?"*

The dwarf spoke for the first time. Low voice, matter-of-fact.

*"Cleric who can destroy armies doesn't need an escort."*

Kael held up a hand. The dwarf went quiet.

Aelindra didn't miss a beat. *"You are correct, a man who can destroy armies doesn't need an escort, but calling down the wrath of god this close to town isn't exactly keeping a low profile. We just don't want to alert the whole town as to the identity of our holy man. People talk and evil people want him dead. Understand?"*

Kael studied Aldric for a long moment -- the plate armor, the shield, the holy symbol at his belt. Her mouth twitched. Not quite a smile.

*"I don't need to know what's in the carts. That's your business."*

She let that hang for a beat.

*"Fifty now, fifty at the inn. Each. Half a day's walk on a quiet road -- we can manage that."*

The magic-user was already nodding. The archer shrugged. The dwarf looked at Kael, then grunted once -- agreement.

Kael extended a hand.

*"Kael. The dwarf is Torgun. Archer's Merik. The one who talks too much is Daven."*

Daven, the magic-user, waved cheerfully.

*"We'll walk your left flank. Your people keep the right and rear. If something happens, Torgun holds the road and the rest of us work from there. Fair?"*

Aelindra paid with a handshake. *"Thank you guys so much, we don't want to attract any more attention than necessary. Let's get moving."*

Kael pocketed hers without counting. *"I understand perfectly. We walk you in, we keep quiet, we get paid, and we forget what your holy man looks like. That's the job."*

She turned to her group. *"Torgun, left side. Merik, keep the tree line. Daven, try not to talk."*

Daven opened his mouth. Closed it. Grinned.

**200gp paid** (50 each, half up front).

The combined group moved east. Eight armed bodies and two carts on the river road.

---

## Day 2 -- Afternoon Approach

The road improved. Packed earth gave way to gravel, then cobblestone. More farms, closer together. A stone mile marker: **THORNWALL -- 3 LEAGUES.** This one was legible.

Traffic picked up. A farmer with an ox cart. A pair of monks in brown robes walking in silence. A mounted courier who thundered past without a glance.

### Intelligence from Merik

During the walk, Merik the archer fell in beside Varro at the rear. He was quiet for a while, then:

*"You lot coming from out past the river fork? Harrow's End way?"*

He didn't wait for much of an answer.

*"Couple of riders came through Thornwall night before last in a hurry. Asking about a tomb on a hill and a group of adventurers who cleared it. Didn't look like they wanted to buy anyone a drink, if you follow me."*

He adjusted his bowstring.

*"Might be nothing. Might be worth knowing."*

He drifted back to his position without another word.

Varro waited a beat, then worked his way over to the archer. *"Thank you for the heads up. That crypt was crawling with undead. Our cleric obliterated them."* He nodded toward the fighter. *"He lost his family to those abominations, but he saw our holy man turn them to dust. For maybe 5 gold more in your pocket, would you by chance remember what these riders looked like?"*

Varro extended a hand with 5 gold.

Merik looked at the coins. Looked at Varro. Took them without hesitation.

*"Didn't get a long look. They came through the east gate at dusk, spent maybe an hour asking around the Ironwater's common room, then rode west hard."*

He scratched his jaw, thinking.

*"Two men, one woman. Well-mounted -- proper riding horses, not farm stock. The woman did the talking. Dark hair pulled back, leather armor under a grey travelling cloak. Carried herself like someone used to giving orders. Wore a silver brooch -- looked like a key or a lockpick, something angular. I noticed because it caught the firelight."*

He paused.

*"One of the men was big. Plate armor, full helm hanging from his saddle. Didn't speak. The other one was thin, pale, kept his hands in his sleeves. Didn't eat, didn't drink. Just watched the room."*

He glanced at Varro.

*"The woman asked the barkeep about 'a group of adventurers working a crypt west of here.' She asked about a cleric specifically -- wanted to know his name. Barkeep didn't know anything, so she moved on to the traders. Nobody knew much. They left before full dark."*

He adjusted his quiver strap.

*"The brooch is the thing I'd watch for. Silver, angular. You'll know it if you see it. And the thin one -- something about him made my skin crawl. I've been at this long enough to trust that feeling."*

He gave Varro a nod.

*"Watch your back in there. Thornwall's a good town, but good towns have corners."*

---

## Arrival at Thornwall

Late afternoon. The town rose ahead.

Stone walls, twelve feet high, patched in places but solid. A wide gate flanked by two watch towers. The river curved around the south side, feeding a mill and a cluster of docks. Smoke from a hundred chimneys. The sound of hammers, voices, a bell from the temple district.

The gate was open. Two guards in leather and chain checked incoming traffic -- a glance at faces, a look at cargo, a nod through. Not aggressive, but not asleep either. Carts with armed escorts weren't unusual in a market town.

Kael walked the party to the market square. Cobblestones. Merchant stalls closing up for the evening. A fountain in the center with a stone lion. The bank was exactly where she'd said -- east side, stone building, iron-banded door, a sign reading **HAVEL & SONS, EXCHANGE AND DEPOSIT.** Closed for the day -- a brass plate on the door read *Open at dawn bell.*

The **Ironwater Inn** sat on the north side of the square. Three stories, timber and stone, warm light in the windows. The smell of roasting meat drifted out.

Kael stopped. Her group formed up behind her.

*"Square. Bank. Inn. As promised."*

She extended her hand for the remaining 200gp.

### The Bank Problem

Aelindra paid the remaining escort fee. *"...and I was just getting to like you guys, I'm going to miss you. Bank is closed so now we have a problem. We can't exactly just hang out here over night. What is the most secure inn? ...and for another 50 gold each, would you mind helping us move the contents of our carts to our rooms for safe keeping until morning? ...and 50 more each if you guard us until dawn and help us make our bank deposit. It's a lot to ask, but I consider you guys friends at this point. Do we have a deal?"*

Kael looked at Aelindra for a long moment. Then she looked at the carts. Then back.

The faintest smile.

*"You know, for a group protecting a holy man, you spend an awful lot of gold on security."*

She let that sit for exactly one beat. Then:

*"The Ironwater's the most secure in town. Stone ground floor, one staircase, the innkeeper locks the front door at midnight and doesn't open it until dawn bell. There's nothing better in Thornwall."*

She crossed her arms.

*"I'll be straight with you. If we move your 'holy relics' upstairs, my people are going to see exactly what we're carrying. And then we'll be the four strangers who know what's in your rooms."*

She held up a hand before Aelindra could respond.

*"So here's what I'll offer instead. We help you move. We take a room on the same floor. Torgun sleeps with one eye open -- that's not a figure of speech, dwarves actually do that. Merik and I take shifts on the landing. Daven sleeps like the dead but he's got an alarm ward he can set on the hallway."*

She unfolded her arms.

*"Fifty each for the move. Fifty each for the night. We walk you to the bank at dawn. And when it's done, we shake hands and forget each other's faces."*

She extended her hand again.

*"But I'll say this once: we're sellswords, not thieves. If that's not good enough, no hard feelings and we part here."*

Torgun grunted. It sounded like agreement. Merik was watching the square -- already working. Daven was eyeing the inn's chimney smoke with naked longing.

The square was emptying. Lanterns were being lit along the storefronts. It would be dark within the hour.

Aelindra paid with a handshake. *"Thank you guys so much, we don't want to attract any more attention than necessary. Let's get moving."*

**Total paid to Kael's group:** 805gp (escort 400gp + move 200gp + overnight 200gp + Merik's tip 5gp).

**Party gold remaining:** ~8,225gp.

---

## First Night at the Ironwater Inn

The innkeeper was a broad, bald man named Gurt. He didn't blink at eight armed people requesting rooms on the same floor.

*"Two silvers a night per room. Three rooms on the second floor, end of the hall. Stable yard's around back -- two coppers per animal. Supper's included."*

**Rooms:** Three total -- one large room for the party (two beds, Bron on the floor), one for Kael's group, one used for cargo. 6sp per night.

The combined group worked quickly and quietly. Kael's people knew how to move heavy loads without fanfare. Sacks went up the back staircase in pairs. The mules and carts were stabled and covered. Within thirty minutes, everything was behind a locked door on the second floor.

Torgun checked the window shutters and the door frame. He nodded once.

*"Solid."*

Daven traced something on the hallway floorboards outside -- a thin line of chalk dust in a pattern. He muttered a word and the chalk glowed faintly, then faded.

*"Anything crosses that line, I'll know."*

### Evening -- The Common Room

The Ironwater's common room was warm, crowded, and loud. Traders, locals, a few off-duty watchmen in the corner nursing ales. Roast mutton, brown bread, boiled turnips. Honest food.

Aldric rested upstairs. Varro kept watch in the cargo room, eating his meal behind a locked door with one ear on the hallway. Torgun was out there somewhere -- the floorboards didn't creak, which was impressive for a dwarf in plate.

Aelindra and Bron took a corner table. She made sure Kael's group had food and drink, remaining friendly and thanking them for their professionalism. Kael's group split -- Torgun stayed upstairs on first watch, the other three ate downstairs at a separate table, keeping distance. Professional. Daven raised his mug to Aelindra with genuine warmth. Merik ate quietly. Kael nodded once -- the kind of nod that meant more from her than a speech from anyone else.

The party didn't telegraph wealth -- a round for their table, a kind word to the serving girl, nothing that drew eyes.

The room hummed with conversation. Fragments drifted to their table:

- Two merchants arguing about road tolls and a new tariff the baron had imposed
- A weathered farmer telling anyone who'd listen about livestock going missing south of town
- A serving girl complaining to the barkeep about a woman who was in two nights ago *"asking strange questions and tipping nothing"*

Merik caught Varro's eye from across the room when the serving girl said that. A slight nod.

### Rumors -- First Night

**From the farmers' table:** A man named Pell had lost three goats and a milk cow in the last two weeks. Something dragging them off at night, south toward the old quarry. *"Not wolves. Wolves leave blood. These just vanish."* Two other farmers nodded -- they'd heard the same. Nobody had gone to look because nobody wanted to go near the quarry after dark.

**From the merchants:** The baron's new road tariff was squeezing the small traders. Caravans heading north to Kingsbridge were taking a longer route through the forest to avoid the toll posts. *"It's not the tax. It's the tax man. He counts every nail in your wagon."* The name **Alderman Crake** came up more than once, never fondly.

**From the serving girl (Nella):** Aelindra bought her a cup when the rush slowed. Nella leaned on the bar and talked freely.

*"The woman? Oh, I remember her. Cold as a fish. Sat right where you're sitting, actually. Leather armor under a grey cloak. Bought one ale and nursed it for an hour."*

She lowered her voice.

*"She asked about adventurers coming from the west. Wanted to know if anyone had been talking about a crypt or a tomb. Asked about a cleric -- didn't have a name, just wanted to know if anyone matching the description had come through. Tall, armored, carries a holy symbol openly."*

Nella wrinkled her nose.

*"The big one in plate just stood by the door the whole time. Didn't sit, didn't eat. The skinny one..."* She shivered. *"He sat in the corner and stared at people. Not at me -- through me. Like he was reading something written on the back of my skull."*

She glanced around.

*"They left fast. Headed west on the river road. Gurt said good riddance."*

Aelindra asked about the brooch.

*"Oh yeah. Silver thing, shaped like... not a key exactly. More like a bent nail? Or a broken cross? I don't know. Never seen that mark before. But she touched it when she talked, like a habit."*

The fire burned low. The common room thinned out. No one had paid their table any special attention. Kael caught Aelindra's eye from across the room and tapped her wrist -- *getting late.*

The party turned in and took two-hour shifts through the night.

### The Night

**Night trouble check (town):** d6 = **3.** Clear.

Between the party's own shifts and Kael's people on the landing, nothing got within twenty feet of the door without four sets of eyes on it. Daven's chalk ward stayed dark all night. Torgun sat in the hallway like a bearded stone and didn't move for six hours straight.

The only sound was Gurt locking the front door at midnight, and the town watch calling the hours from the wall.

---

## Dawn -- The Bank

The dawn bell rang from the temple district. Grey light through the shutters. The smell of porridge from downstairs.

Kael's group was already up -- professionals. Merik had circles under his eyes but his bow was strung. Torgun looked exactly the same as he had twelve hours ago.

The combined group moved the cargo back downstairs and across the square in the early morning quiet. A few bakers and water-carriers were out. Nobody else.

**Havel & Sons, Exchange and Deposit** opened its iron door at the bell. Inside: a stone-floored counting room, heavy oak desk, iron-bound strongboxes along the wall. An older man in a pressed wool coat -- Havel himself, wire spectacles, ink-stained fingers -- looked up from a ledger.

*"Good morning. Deposit or exchange?"*

He didn't flinch at the sacks. He'd seen gold before.

Havel charged 1% for secure deposit and provided a sealed letter of credit -- heavy paper, wax seal, his signature and a stamped number -- redeemable at partner banks in Kingsbridge and two other major towns. He counted methodically, stacking coins in neat towers of ten.

The party kept 200gp to pay Kael's final installment, then 200gp each as walking money. The rest went into deposit.

Bron's quarter share was separated into its own account at his request. First time he'd ever had a bank account. Havel handed him a separate letter of credit and Bron folded it carefully into his belt pouch like it was made of glass.

*"I'd recommend not losing that."*

| Account | Deposited |
|---------|-----------|
| Party (Aelindra, Varro, Aldric) | ~5,553gp |
| Bron | ~1,600gp |

---

## Farewell to Kael's Group

Outside the bank. Morning light on the cobblestones. Kael took the final 200gp and split it four ways without ceremony.

Aelindra said, *"Do you guys come back here often? You have been a great help to us. We would love to work with you guys again, if fate allows it."*

Kael paused. She looked at her group. Daven gave an enthusiastic nod. Merik shrugged -- which from him meant yes. Torgun was already looking west.

*"We work the triangle -- Thornwall, Kingsbridge, the border towns. We're usually in Thornwall every few weeks to resupply."*

She pulled something from her belt pouch -- a small iron coin with a notch cut in the edge. Not currency. A token.

*"Show that at the Ironwater's bar. Gurt holds messages for us. If you need us, leave word. If we're close, we'll come."*

She looked at Aelindra properly. Something had shifted behind the professional mask -- not much, but enough.

*"You paid fair. You didn't lie about what mattered. And you didn't treat us like hired muscle."* A beat. *"That's rarer than you'd think."*

She shook Aelindra's hand one more time. Firm.

*"Stay sharp. Whoever those riders were, they knew what they were looking for. And they didn't find it in Thornwall, which means they went looking somewhere else."*

Torgun was already walking. Merik lifted two fingers in a quiet salute to Varro. Daven waved like he was leaving a birthday party.

Kael turned and followed her group west, toward whatever lead had brought them out here in the first place.

---

## Shopping in Thornwall

The elf looked at the group. *"Let's go shopping!"*

Thornwall's market square opened up as the morning trade got moving. This wasn't Henk's Trading Post -- this was a proper town with proper shops.

### Available Shops

**Grenn's Armory** (north side, off the square): A heavyset woman with scarred forearms running the forge. Plate mail (60gp, needs fitting), chain mail (40gp), leather (20gp), shields, helmets, swords, silver dagger (30gp).

**Harwick's Outfitters** (east side, near the bank): General adventuring gear. A thin, fussy man who knew his inventory by heart. Rope, iron spikes, poles, grappling hooks, lanterns, oil flasks (2gp each, 12 in stock), torches, mirrors, backpacks, bedrolls, rations, wolfsbane, garlic, holy water (25gp), thieves' tools.

**The Temple of the White Shield** (temple district, south): Modest stone temple. Holy water (25gp, 6 in stock), holy symbols, healing poultices (10gp each, heals 1d3, 4 in stock), Scroll of Protection from Evil (200gp).

**Voss the Jeweler** (south corner): Iron bars on the windows. Buys gems, appraises jewelry, converts gold to gems (5% fee).

**Thornwall Stables** (west gate): Proper riding horses (75gp), saddle and tack (25gp).

### Purchases

Aelindra took charge. *"Bron, do you want an upgrade? I'm thinking plate mail and a sword to go with that shield of yours."* She looked at the cleric. *"You could use some of the healing poultice. Buy all four! ...and maybe a couple more holy waters."* She looked at the thief. *"Anything you want? You should stock up on oil flasks! ...and grab another rope, we left ours behind in the crypt."*

Bron's eyes went wide at the mention of plate mail. *"I... yes. Yes, I'd like that very much."*

Grenn said the plate mail needed fitting -- a full day. Bron would pick it up two hours past noon the next day. The party decided to wait.

| Buyer | Item | Price |
|-------|------|-------|
| Aelindra (for Bron) | Plate mail (fitting required) | 60gp |
| Aelindra (for Bron) | Sword | 10gp |
| Aldric | Healing poultice x4 | 40gp |
| Aldric | Holy water x2 (temple) | 50gp |
| Varro | Oil flasks x6 | 12gp |
| Varro | Rope, 50' | 1gp |
| Party | Rations, 1 week x4 | 20gp |
| Party | Inn (2 rooms, 1 night, stabling) | 5sp |
| **Total** | | **193gp 5sp** |

| Character | Gold Remaining |
|-----------|---------------|
| Aelindra | 130gp |
| Varro | 187gp |
| Aldric | 110gp |
| Bron | 200gp |

Bron got measured at Grenn's. She chalked his shoulders, tapped his ribs with a knuckle, grunted. *"Pick it up tomorrow, two hours past noon."* He walked out carrying a proper sword for the first time in his life.

---

## Second Evening at the Ironwater

Aldric and Varro ate upstairs behind a locked door. Varro sat with his back to the wall, sling in his lap, listening to the hallway.

Downstairs, Aelindra and Bron took a corner table. She bought a round for the nearest tables -- not lavish, just friendly. Bron followed her lead, nursing his ale and looking like a man who'd seen some hard road. They played the part well: two adventurers between jobs, hoping someone needed muscle. They asked if anyone knew of work for a party of adventurers who were "down on their luck."

**Town trouble check:** d6 = **4.** Clear. Nobody was watching them.

### Three Leads

**The Quarry Job (Pell the farmer, back again tonight):**
Pell recognized adventurer-types when he saw them. He slid into the seat across from Aelindra without being invited.

*"You lot looking for work? I've got work. Three goats and my best milk cow, gone. Dragged off at night toward the old Greystone Quarry. No blood. No tracks past the quarry rim. That's not natural."*

He leaned in.

*"I talked to the watch. They said they'd 'look into it.' That was two weeks ago. I'm offering fifty gold out of my own pocket to anyone who goes down there and brings back proof of what's doing this. Fifty more if you stop it."*

He glanced around.

*"And I'm not the only one losing stock. Pell, Wicker, old Marta on the south road -- we've all lost animals. Something moved into that quarry and it's getting bolder."*

**The Bounty Board (overheard from an off-duty watchman):**
Standing bounty: 25gp per bandit brought in alive from the forest road north of town. A gang hitting caravans avoiding the baron's toll road. The watch was stretched too thin to handle it. *"Alderman Crake's got the budget for bounties but not for patrols. Figure that one out."*

**Wine Escort to Kingsbridge (Sefton, a wine trader):**
A pudgy man in a velvet cap bought Aelindra a drink in return.

*"If you're heading north toward Kingsbridge, I'll pay sixty gold for an escort. Four days on the forest road. I've got two wagons of Southmark red and no guards since my last pair quit over the bandit business."*

He sipped his wine.

*"The baronial toll road is safe but the tariff would eat my profit. The forest road is faster and cheaper -- if you don't get robbed."*

### The Decision

The party chose the quarry. Pell said they could start tomorrow after picking up Bron's armor. He pulled a rough copper ring off his finger and set it on the table.

*"Show this to my wife at the farmstead south of town -- it's on the way. She'll point you to where the last cow was taken from. The drag marks lead straight to the quarry rim."*

He stood, tugged his hat.

*"Fifty when you bring me proof of what it is. Fifty more when it stops. I'll be here tomorrow night."*

## Morning -- Thornwall, Day Three

Clear skies. Cool wind from the north. The party ate breakfast at the inn. Varro reported a quiet night -- no one tried the door, no one lingered in the hall. Bron's plate mail would be ready at two hours past noon, leaving the morning free.

### Intelligence Gathering

Aldric stayed in the room. Varro stayed with him. Aelindra and Bron split up to cover more ground.

**Aelindra -- Harwick's General Store:**

Old Harwick remembered the quarry well.

*"Greystone shut down before you were born, girl. Twenty-some years ago. The upper cuts were fine stone -- half the buildings in Thornwall are Greystone granite. But the deeper tunnels hit something wrong. Bad air. Men got sick down there, headaches, couldn't keep food down. The foreman pulled everyone out and they never went back."*

He thought for a moment.

*"There's three levels of tunnels cut into the hillside. Top level's just shallow cuts, open to the sky. Second level goes deeper -- that's where the good stone was. Third level is where the trouble started. They braced it with timbers but I doubt those are still standing."*

She asked about entrances. He held up two fingers.

*"Main ramp goes down into the pit from the north. Wide enough for ox carts. There used to be a second way in -- a ventilation shaft on the hilltop above. Whether it's still open..."* He shrugged.

**Bron -- The Watch House:**

The sergeant on duty was a thick-armed woman named Dalla. Blunt.

*"One of my men went out there eight days ago. Walked the rim, went down the ramp partway. Came back saying the whole place smelled wrong. Not rot -- something else. Sharp, like old swamp mud. Made his eyes water."*

She tapped the desk.

*"He didn't go into the tunnels. I didn't ask him to. I've got six guards for a market town -- I can't afford to lose one in a hole in the ground."*

Bron asked if she'd seen any tracks.

*"Pell's cow left drag marks in the dirt right up to the quarry stone. Once it hits bare rock, nothing. Whatever it is, it stays on the stone."*

**Aelindra -- The Temple (Brother Oswin):**

A young acolyte, nervous. He'd heard the farmers talk.

*"What bothers me is that nothing comes back. No bones, no hide, no blood. A wolf leaves remains. A bear leaves remains. This... takes everything."*

He hesitated.

*"There's one more thing. Old Marta -- she lives closest to the quarry. She told me she saw something on her fence at dusk, two weeks ago. Said it looked like a man crouching, but the color was wrong. Like it was made of the same stone as the fence. When she looked again, it was gone."*

Aelindra and Bron met back at the inn over lunch and compared notes:

| Detail | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Three tunnel levels; deepest had "bad air" that made workers sick | Harwick |
| Main ramp entrance (north), possible ventilation shaft on hilltop | Harwick |
| Sharp, swamp-like smell -- not rot | Watch sergeant Dalla |
| Drag marks end at bare stone -- no tracks on rock | Watch sergeant Dalla |
| Something on Marta's fence at dusk -- looked like stone-colored man | Brother Oswin |
| Animals taken whole -- no remains whatsoever | Multiple |

Bron frowned. *"Stone-colored. Stays on rock. Bad smell. That sound like anything to you?"*

### The Temple -- Sister Thessaly

The party searched the town for the oldest, wisest cleric they could find. Brother Oswin led Aelindra to the back of the temple, past the prayer hall, to a small study that smelled of dried herbs and old parchment.

An ancient woman sat by the window, wrapped in a grey shawl. Her eyes were milky but sharp. Sister Thessaly -- she'd been at the Thornwall temple for forty years.

Aelindra described what they'd gathered: the stone-colored figure, the stench, no tracks on rock, animals taken whole.

Thessaly listened without interrupting. When Aelindra finished, the old woman nodded slowly.

*"Troglodytes."*

She said the word like she'd been waiting for it.

*"Reptile-folk. Cave dwellers. I haven't seen one, but I've read the accounts. They were in the deeps under the Greymount hills two generations ago before the dwarves drove them out."*

She held up fingers as she listed.

*"Their skin shifts color to match stone. Standing still against a quarry wall, you'd walk right past one. That's how they hunt -- they don't chase. They wait."*

*"The stench is the real danger. Not the claws, not the teeth -- the* smell. *It comes off their skin when they're agitated. Men who've fought them say it hits like a wall. Your eyes water, your stomach turns, you can't swing straight."*

Aelindra asked how to fight them.

*"They're flesh and blood. Not undead, not demonic. Your cleric's prayers won't turn them. Steel and fire will kill them same as anything else."*

She paused, then reached for a clay jar on the shelf.

*"Soak cloth in vinegar and tie it over your mouth and nose before you go in. It won't stop the stench entirely but it dulls it enough to keep your sword arm steady. I'd prepare one for each of you."*

She handed Aelindra the jar.

*"One more thing. They're not animals. They think. They plan. They set ambushes. If they've been raiding farms, they have a lair down there -- and there'll be more than one or two. Expect a pack. Six, eight, maybe more if they've been feeding well."*

She fixed Aelindra with those milky eyes.

*"And they'll know you're coming long before you see them."*

Sister Thessaly gave them enough vinegar for four cloths. Free of charge -- *"Consider it the temple's contribution."*

### Temple Donation

The party donated 20 gold to the temple. The elf said, *"Pay a blessing for us!"*

Sister Thessaly took the coins with both hands and dipped her head.

*"I'll light a candle for each of you tonight. May the light find you in the dark places."*

Brother Oswin walked Aelindra to the temple door, looking worried.

*"Be careful down there. And... if you find out what happened to Marta's goats, tell her? She's been losing sleep over it."*

**Aelindra's gold after donation:** 110gp.

## Bron's Armor

Two hours past noon. Bron walked out of Grenn's armory rolling his shoulders in fitted steel plate. He looked like a different man. He rapped a knuckle against the chest piece and grinned.

*"Fits perfect."*

---

## The Road South -- Afternoon

The party gathered at the inn, loaded up, and tied the vinegar cloths around their necks ready to pull up when needed. They headed south on the old cart road.

The cart road narrowed to a rutted track after the last farmsteads. Pell's wife spotted the copper ring, pointed southwest without a word, and went back inside. The drag marks were still visible in the dirt -- deep grooves, like something heavy had been pulled.

After three hours of walking, the land rose into low scrubby hills. The track ended at a wide, flat area of trampled earth.

### The Greystone Quarry -- Arrival

An open pit, roughly 200 feet across, cut into the side of a steep hill. The north face had been carved away in terraces, exposing pale grey granite. A wide ramp -- broad enough for two ox carts side by side -- descended into the pit from where they stood.

The bottom of the pit was about 40 feet down. From the rim:

- **Level 1:** Shallow horizontal cuts into the rock face, open to the sky. Rubble and old iron tools scattered about.
- **Level 2:** A large dark opening in the south wall of the pit, about 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. Timber framing, visibly rotten. The deeper tunnels begin here.
- **Level 3:** Not visible from here -- deeper inside.

The late afternoon sun lit the upper pit well. The tunnel mouth on Level 2 was in shadow.

No sound. No birds. The wind carried a faint smell -- sharp, like stagnant marsh water.

**The session ends here, at the quarry rim, with approximately three hours of daylight remaining.**
