## Preparation

### Shopping in Harrow's End

The party returned to town after discovering the concealed stairway behind the altar in the western shrine. They knew something waited below and came back to prepare.

**Purchases:**

| Buyer | Item | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| Aldric | Holy water x3 | 75gp |
| Varro | Torches x6 | 1gp |
| Varro | Oil flasks x5 | 10gp |
| **Total** | | **86gp** |

Aldric now holds 5 holy water vials. Varro has 5 oil flasks.

---

### Hiring a Retainer

> **Player:** The elf asks the shopkeeper if they are aware of anyone in town looking for adventure for a share of any treasure recovered. They need to be a tough fighter who isn't afraid of the undead.

Henk at the trading post points them to the Crooked Nail.

*"Name's Bron. Used to track wolves for the bounty before the trouble started. Big lad. He's been sharpening that axe of his for a week, talking about going up there himself."*

---

Bron's cousin Edric was one of the two woodcutters who vanished on Gallows Hill. He wants answers more than gold.

*"My cousin Edric went up that hill three weeks ago. Haven't seen him since. I don't care about gold. I want to see what's in that tomb, and I want to put an axe through whatever took him."*

> **Player:** The thief hands him 2 of the oil flasks and says, "We are going to burn as many undead as we can!"

**Oil flask distribution:** Varro 3, Bron 2. Wicks prepared.

---

**Marching Order:** Varro (pole, torch) -- Aldric & Bron (side by side) -- Aelindra (rear)

---

## Turn 1 -- Through Known Ground

The party descends into the tomb for the fourth time. Familiar corridors at triple pace. The spiked door to the east -- silence behind it. West passage. Through the archway. Into the shrine with its silver-inlaid mosaic and black altar. The concealed door behind the altar stands ajar.

**Wandering monster check:** d6 = **2.** Clear.

---

## Turn 2 -- The Shrine of Valdros

The black-tiled chamber with the mosaic of Valdros in silver and gold wire. Carved reliefs on the walls -- a lord commanding armies, presiding over feasts, raising a sword above a kneeling enemy. An altar of black stone against the far wall bearing a crescent moon cradling a skull.

**Varro checks for traps.** (Find Traps: 20%)
Roll: **43.** Nothing detected.

**Aelindra searches for secret doors.** (2-in-6)
Roll: **2.** Success.

She finds the concealed door behind the altar -- a seam in the stone, hinged on the left. Through the crack, a draft of air so cold it burns.

*"That sword is enchanted,"* she whispers. *"I can feel it from here."*

Beyond: a narrow stairway cut into raw bedrock, descending steeply into darkness. Twelve steps. No heat signatures. The smell of ancient incense and old death.

---

## Turn 3 -- The Burial Chamber of Valdros the Pale

**Marching order (single file, stairs too narrow):** Varro -- Aldric -- Bron -- Aelindra

Twelve steps down into dry, frozen rock. No moisture. No fungus. Just bare stone and cold beyond cold.

The stairway opens into a square chamber, 20 feet to a side, the ceiling low enough that Aldric has to duck. The walls are carved in deep relief -- scenes of battle and conquest. Fine craftsmanship, centuries old.

In the center: a **massive sarcophagus of black stone**, sealed with bands of dull lead. Symbols carved into the lead -- old wards. Four dark gems set into the corners of the lid.

In stone niches lining the walls: **gold coins**, stacked in neat columns. Thousands of them.

And behind the sarcophagus, mounted on iron brackets on the far wall: **a sword.** The blade catches the torchlight wrong -- it seems to drink the light in and push it back brighter. The crossguard is etched with symbols Aelindra recognizes instantly.

*"That sword is enchanted. I can feel it from here."*

Bron takes a step toward the gold.

The lead bands on the sarcophagus **crack.**

The lid shudders. Then, slowly, with terrible deliberation, it begins to slide sideways. Stone grinding against stone. The four gems flare with cold light.

A hand emerges. Long, grey, the fingers tapered to points like talons. What rises from within is tall, gaunt, dressed in rotting remnants of a nobleman's robes -- black and silver, hanging in shreds. The face is the same as the mosaic upstairs, but drawn tight over the skull, lips pulled back from grey teeth, eyes burning with pale, cold light.

He turns those eyes on the party. He sees them. He *knows* them.

His hands begin to glow with a faint, corpse-pale luminescence.

---

**No surprise.**

**Initiative!**
- Party: **5**
- Valdros: **3**

**The party acts first!**

| | AC | HP | THAC0 | Attacks | Special |
|--|-----|-----|-------|---------|---------|
| Valdros the Pale | 5 [14] | **16** | 17 [+2] | Touch | Drains 1 level per hit. Only silver/magic harms. Undead. ML 12. |

---

## Combat: Valdros the Pale

> **Player:** The cleric turns undead, while the fighter and thief throw flasks of oil at Valdros. The elf casts magic missile at Valdros!

### Round 1 -- Party Acts

**Aldric -- Turn Undead** (Level 3 Cleric vs Wight, needs **9+** on 2d6)
Roll: **7. FAIL.**

The words of banishment die in the air. Valdros tilts his head -- and *smiles*. A rictus grin, thin and cruel. Whatever this thing is, it is old, and beyond the reach of a young cleric's faith.

*"It didn't work. It didn't--"*

*"THROW EVERYTHING!"* Varro shouts.

---

**Varro -- Oil Flask (lit)**
d20 = **17** + DEX +2 + short range +1 = **20** vs AC 5. **Hit!**
Damage: 1d8 = **6.**

The flask shatters across Valdros's chest. Oil splashes over the rotting robes and ignites. The creature lurches backward, clawing at the fire.

**Valdros: 16 → 10 HP. On fire.**

---

**Bron -- Oil Flask (lit)**
d20 = **9** + short range +1 = **10** vs AC 5. **Miss!**

The flask clips the sarcophagus and sprays burning oil across the stone. Valdros steps clear. The enchanted sword on the far wall is suddenly framed in fire.

---

**Aelindra -- Magic Missile**
Auto-hit. Damage: 1d6+1 = **5.**

A bolt of blue-white force punches through Valdros's burning torso. He doubles over, clutching the wound -- then straightens. Still standing. Still burning.

**Valdros: 10 → 5 HP.**

---

### Round 1 -- Valdros Acts

He comes through the fire like a nightmare. Burning robes trailing flame, pale-glowing hands reaching for Aldric -- the one who dared try to command him.

**Valdros attacks Aldric!** THAC0 17 vs AC 3. Needs **14+**.
Roll: **12. Miss!**

Aldric gets his shield up. The burning talons scrape across the metal with a sound like tearing metal, leaving four deep gouges and a coating of frost. Close. Inches from his skin.

---

**End of Round 1 -- Burning oil damage:**
1d8 = **3.** Valdros: 5 → **2 HP.**

---

### Round 2 -- Initiative

- Party: **4**
- Valdros: **1**

**Party acts first!**

> **Player:** The elf yells, "Stay back! Don't let him touch you!" Aldric steps back and throws a vial of holy water at Valdros. Aelindra throws the silver dagger at Valdros. Bron and Varro each throw another oil flask.

**Aldric -- Holy Water**
d20 = **16** - DEX 1 + short range +1 = **16** vs AC 5. **Hit!**
Damage: 1d8 = **7.**

The vial shatters against Valdros's skull. Blessed water explodes across his face. The flesh *dissolves*. Valdros throws his head back, jaw unhinging in a silent shriek.

**Valdros: 2 → -5 HP. DESTROYED.**

---

**Aelindra -- Silver Dagger (thrown)**
d20 = **13** + DEX +1 + short range +1 = **15** vs AC 5. **Hit.**

The silver dagger spins end over end and buries itself in Valdros's chest, silver burning into dead flesh like a brand.

**Varro -- Oil Flask**
d20 = **14** + DEX +2 + short range +1 = **17** vs AC 5. **Hit.**

**Bron -- Oil Flask**
d20 = **11** + short range +1 = **12** vs AC 5. **Miss.**

---

## The Death of Valdros the Pale

It's over before the last flask hits the ground.

Valdros the Pale -- lord of this hill, terror of Harrow's End, centuries-old and hungry -- collapses. Not slowly, not dramatically. He folds like a puppet with cut strings, crumbling inward, the fire consuming what the holy water doesn't. The silver dagger glows white-hot in his chest. His robes disintegrate. His bones crack and split in the heat.

The pale light in his eyes gutters. Flickers.

Goes out.

What falls to the floor is not a body. It's ash, fragments of blackened bone, and the silver dagger lying clean and bright among the cinders.

Silence.

Bron lowers his arm slowly. His hand is shaking. *"Is it done?"*

Aelindra steps forward and retrieves her dagger from the ash. She wipes it clean on her cloak. *"It's done. He won't be getting up again."*

Aldric leans against the wall, breathing hard. *"My turning failed. If you hadn't brought the oil..."*

*"That's why we brought the oil,"* Varro says. He's grinning.

---

## The Hoard of Valdros

**In the wall niches:** Gold coins, stacked in neat columns by hands that have been dust for centuries.

**Set into the four corners of the sarcophagus:** Four gems, pried loose with a dagger.

**On the wall behind the sarcophagus:** The sword. A longsword with a blade of pale steel holding a faint blue-white luminescence. The crossguard shaped like swept wings. Runes etched along the fuller, pulsing with soft light. When Aelindra lifts it from the brackets and holds it near Valdros's ashes, the runes blaze like cold fire.

*"These runes -- they're wards against the undead. This sword was made to destroy things like him."*

**Sword +1, +3 vs Undead** -- +1 to attack and damage normally, +3 to attack and damage against all undead. Counts as a magical weapon.

Varro whistles low. *"Someone put that sword in here for a reason. Maybe to keep him sealed. Maybe to kill him if he ever got out."*

*"Either way,"* Aelindra says, *"it's ours now."*

**Treasure Found:**

| Item | Value | Weight |
|------|-------|--------|
| Gold coins | 3,000gp | 3,000cn |
| Deep red garnet | 500gp | 1cn |
| Polished amethyst | 100gp | 1cn |
| Smoky quartz | 50gp | 1cn |
| Rough agate | 10gp | 1cn |
| **Sword +1, +3 vs Undead** | *priceless* | 60cn |

**Total gold value: 3,660gp**

---

## Turns 5-6 -- The Long Haul

> **Player:** Okay guys, tomorrow we deal with the ghouls. But now, let's split up the gold and start the haul back to town!

The gold is divided. Every pack, every pouch, every pocket. Aelindra swaps her normal sword for the enchanted blade.

**Gold distribution:**

| Character | Gold | Gems | Total Weight | MV |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|-----|
| Aldric | 750gp | -- | **1,600cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Aelindra | 740gp | -- | **1,600cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Varro | 750gp | all 4 (660gp) | **1,454cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Bron | 760gp | -- | **1,240cn** | **30'(10')** |

Crawling pace. The stairs are the worst part.

**Wandering monster check (Turn 5):** d6 = **4.** Clear.
**Wandering monster check (Turn 6):** d6 = **3.** Clear.

They pass the spiked door. Silence behind it. Even the ghouls seem to know something has changed. Their master is gone.

---

## Daylight

The party emerges onto Gallows Hill under a pale afternoon sky. Bron drops his pack on the grass and sits down hard.

*"We killed a lord of the dead,"* Aldric says quietly, looking back at the dark entrance. *"And we walked out."*

Aelindra draws the enchanted sword and holds it up to the sun. The runes pulse with soft blue-white light, then dim in the daylight.

*"Tomorrow. We finish the rest."*

Three ghouls behind a spiked door with 3,000sp (300gp). Now that Aelindra carries a sword that deals +3 against undead and Aldric has second-level spell slots, those ghouls are living on borrowed time.

Bron hasn't found his cousin Edric. The woodcutter's fate remains unknown.

---

Two level-ups, a magic sword, and a dead lord. Not a scratch on anyone. That's what preparation looks like.
