---

## The Adventure Hook

The village of Harrow's End sits at the edge of the Thornmire, a miserable cluster of wattle-and-daub huts surrounded by a palisade that's seen better decades. The villagers are frightened. Livestock have been found dead -- drained of blood, their bodies cold and grey. Two woodcutters vanished last week. An old shepherd swears he saw figures moving among the barrow mounds on Gallows Hill after dark.

The village elder, a weathered woman named Marda, meets your party at the Crooked Nail tavern. She sets three silver coins on the table -- all the village can spare as a down payment.

*"The old tomb on Gallows Hill. It belonged to some lord from before my grandmother's time -- Valdros, they called him. It was sealed shut for generations, but last month the rains washed out the hillside and now the entrance stands open. That's when the trouble started. Clear it out, and everything you find inside is yours to keep. We just want our dead to stay dead."*

The hill is a half-day's walk north. Your party has provisioned and stands at the dungeon entrance as the afternoon sun hangs low.

---

## Turn 1 -- The Entrance

A rough stone archway yawns in the exposed hillside. Crumbled earth and roots frame the opening. A flight of worn steps descends into darkness. The air rising from below is cold and carries the faint smell of damp earth and something else -- something sweetly rotten.

**Light:** Torch #1 burning (30', lasts 1 hour / 6 turns)

> **Player:** Slowly and carefully descend the steps.

Aldric leads the way, shield raised, torch held high in his left hand. Aelindra follows three steps behind, eyes adjusting between torchlight and the faint silver glow of her infravision. Varro brings up the rear, one hand on the wall, listening.

**Varro listens at the stairway.** (Hear Noise: 1-3 on d6)
Roll: **4.** He hears nothing but the drip of water and the party's own breathing.

The party descends. The steps are slick with moisture and worn smooth in the center by centuries of feet. Thirty steps down, the stairway levels into a corridor of dressed stone, roughly 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. The masonry is precise but ancient -- hairline cracks run along the mortar, and patches of pale fungus cling to the ceiling.

---

## Turn 2 -- The T-Intersection

The corridor runs north about 40 feet before reaching a **T-intersection**. Aldric's torchlight reaches just far enough to see the passage splits left (west) and right (east).

As the party approaches the intersection, they notice:
- To the **west**, the passage continues into darkness. A faint draft comes from this direction -- the air slightly colder.
- To the **east**, the passage runs about 20 feet before ending at a **closed wooden door**, swollen with damp. Scratches mark the stone floor in front of it, as if something heavy has been dragged through recently.

**Wandering monster check (Turn 2):** d6 = **3.** Nothing stirs.

**Light:** Torch #1 (5 turns remaining)

> **Player:** Go east and listen at the door. Aelindra will listen.

The party moves east down the short passage. The drag marks on the floor are clearer now -- parallel grooves scored into the stone, as if something with claws hauled a heavy weight toward the door. A dark stain smears the flagstones near the threshold.

Aelindra presses her ear to the swollen wood.

**Aelindra listens at the door.** (Elf: 2-in-6)
Roll: **2.** Success.

She holds up a closed fist -- *silence* -- then raises three fingers. She mouths the words to the others:

*"Three of them. Chewing. Wet sounds -- like teeth scraping bone."*

Through the warped planks, she can just make out the faint, rhythmic crunch of something feeding. Multiple somethings. Occasionally a low hiss, like air escaping a punctured bellows.

The door is closed but not locked -- the latch is a simple iron lift-bar, green with corrosion. The hinges are on your side. The drag marks lead directly under the door.

Aelindra catches Aldric's eye and taps her holy symbol meaningfully. He nods -- he knows what feeds in tombs.

---

## Turn 3 -- The Feeding Chamber

> **Player:** Aldric casts Protection from Evil on the party, then opens the door cautiously.

**DM Note:** Protection from Evil has a range of **self only**. Aldric can't cast it on the whole party. He murmurs the prayer, touching his holy symbol to his brow. A faint shimmer of divine light settles over him.

**Aldric casts Protection from Evil on himself.** Duration: 12 turns. Foes suffer -1 to attack him, he gets +1 to all saving throws. His Cure Light Wounds remains memorized.

*That cost 1 round. The spell takes effect.*

Aldric lifts the corroded iron latch and pushes the door inward. It groans on its hinges, grinding against the stone floor. Torchlight floods the chamber beyond.

### The Feeding Chamber

A rectangular burial vault, roughly 30 feet deep and 20 feet wide. Three stone sarcophagi line the far wall, their heavy lids shoved aside and lying cracked on the floor. The remains of a deer carcass lie in the center of the room, half-consumed, the ribcage split open.

Crouched over the carcass are **three hunched figures**. Grey skin stretched taut over elongated limbs. Distended jaws slick with dark fluid. Long, filthy claws. They look up at the torchlight with hollow, hungry eyes -- and hiss.

**No surprise** -- your torchlight announced you. They knew you were coming the moment light crept under the door.

**Encounter distance:** 20 feet.

**Initiative!**
- Party rolls: **4**
- Creatures roll: **2**

**The party acts first!**

The three creatures are rising from their meal, spreading apart, claws flexing. They are 20 feet away. Aldric stands in the doorway (10' wide -- room for two abreast). Aelindra is behind him. Varro behind her.

| Creature | AC | HP | THAC0 | Attacks | Special |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|---------|
| Grey thing #1 | 6 [13] | 11 | 18 [+1] | 2 claws + bite | Paralysis (save vs paralysis or frozen 2d4 turns) |
| Grey thing #2 | 6 [13] | 7 | 18 [+1] | 2 claws + bite | Same |
| Grey thing #3 | 6 [13] | 9 | 18 [+1] | 2 claws + bite | Same |

*Aelindra recognizes them immediately. She's fought their kind before -- and she knows their touch cannot freeze elven blood.*

> **Player:** Slam the door. We want to spike the door to keep it from opening.

### Round 1 -- Party Acts First

**Aldric** throws his weight against the door and heaves it shut. The swollen wood grinds back into the frame with a heavy thud.

**Varro** is already on his knees. He pulls two iron spikes from his pack, jams one into the gap between the door's base and the flagstone floor, and drives it home with the butt of his dagger. *CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.* He wedges the second spike at an angle against the door frame.

**Aelindra** braces her shoulder against the door, holding it firm while Varro works.

**Ghouls' turn:** A heartbeat later -- WHAM. The door shudders as bodies slam against the other side. Claws rake against the wood. A high, keening shriek, furious and hungry. WHAM. The spikes hold. The door groans but doesn't budge.

More scratching. More hissing. Then -- silence. The scratching stops. The faint scrape of claws on stone receding from the door. They've backed off.

For now.

---

*"That was the smart call,"* Varro mutters, wiping sweat from his forehead. *"I don't fancy getting grabbed by those things in a doorway."*

Aldric nods, his Prot from Evil still shimmering faintly. *"They're undead. I can feel it. When we go back in, I'll turn them. But let's see what else is down here first -- I'd rather not have something at our backs."*

**Varro's iron spikes:** 10 remaining (used 2)

**Light:** Torch #1 (4 turns remaining)

---

## Turn 4 -- The West Passage

> **Player:** Cautiously explore the west passage.

The party reverses down the corridor back to the T-intersection and turns west, into the cold draft.

**Varro checks for traps** as they move. (Find Traps: 20%)
Roll: **74.** He doesn't spot anything.

The west passage is narrower than the main corridor -- about 8 feet wide, the ceiling lower. The cold draft is steady against their faces, carrying a mineral smell like wet limestone. The walls here are rougher, less finished. Whoever built this tomb carved deeper into the hill on this side.

After about 30 feet, the passage splits:

- A **narrow side passage** (5 feet wide) branches **south**. It's dark and the floor slopes slightly downward. Aelindra's infravision catches no heat signatures in the first 60 feet -- just cold stone.

- The **main corridor continues west** another 20 feet, ending at an **open stone archway**. Beyond the archway, the torchlight catches the edge of a larger space -- the floor changes from rough-cut stone to smooth, dark tile. Something glints faintly on the floor.

**Wandering monster check (Turn 4):** d6 = **5.** Clear.

**Aelindra listens.** (2-in-6)
Roll: **5.** She hears nothing from either direction -- only the draft, which is coming from the **south passage**.

**Light:** Torch #1 (3 turns remaining)

---

## Turn 5 -- The South Passage and the Pit

> **Player:** Go to the south.

The party squeezes into the narrow south passage single file. At 5 feet wide, there's no room for two abreast.

**Marching order (forced):** Aldric -- Aelindra -- Varro

The floor slopes gently downward. The walls are rougher here, the chisel marks wider -- this passage was carved in haste, or by less skilled hands. The cold draft blows steadily upward past them, carrying a faint earthy dampness.

Aldric takes three steps. Four. Five --

**CRACK.**

The flagstone under Aldric's right boot gives way. A concealed pit, 10 feet deep, spanning the full width of the passage. The stone lid hinges downward and Aldric drops.

**Pit trap triggered!** (2-in-6 trigger: rolled **2**)
*Varro's earlier trap check (20%) failed -- he didn't spot the seam in the stonework.*

Aldric grabs for the edge --

**Save vs. Paralysis to catch the lip:** needs 14 (+1 from Prot Evil = needs **13**).
Roll: **11.** He falls.

Aldric crashes to the bottom of the pit in a clatter of plate mail and shield. His torch bounces off the wall and lands beside him, still burning.

**Damage: 1d6 = 3.** Aldric takes 3 points of damage. (HP: 17 -> 14)

*"I'm alright!"* he calls up, voice echoing in the narrow shaft. He's sitting on damp stone at the bottom, 10 feet down, bruised but intact. The pit is rough-cut -- climbable with help.

Aelindra pulls up short at the edge, boots skidding on the stone lip. She peers down. *"Next time, we buy a ten-foot pole."*

The pit is 10 feet deep and 10 feet long (north-south). Beyond it, the passage continues south. From down in the pit, Aldric can see the passage continues another 15 feet before opening into what looks like a **small natural cavern** -- the walls are no longer carved stone but raw rock. The draft is coming from there.

**Getting Aldric out:** Varro has 50 feet of rope. Lower it down, Aldric climbs up. Takes the rest of this turn.

**Light:** Torch #1 (2 turns remaining -- down in the pit with Aldric)

---

## Turn 6 -- Crossing the Pit

> **Player:** Pull him up and continue south.

Varro hammers a spike into the stone at the pit's edge and loops the rope around it. One by one, the party lowers themselves into the pit, crosses the bottom, and Aldric boosts the others up the far side before climbing the rope himself. Time-consuming but safe.

**Torch #1 gutters out.** Aldric lights **Torch #2.** (5 remaining after this one)

The passage continues south another 15 feet before the carved walls give way to raw, natural rock. The party steps into --

---

## Turn 7 -- The Cavern

### The Cavern

An irregular natural cave, roughly 25 feet across, the ceiling rising to about 12 feet. Stalactites hang from above. The cold draft is stronger here, whistling through a narrow crack in the far wall -- too small to pass through. Moisture beads on every surface. The floor is uneven, scattered with loose stone.

Aldric raises the torch and the light sweeps across the ceiling --

**Something is up there.**

A glistening, segmented body, pale and bloated, clings to the stalactites directly above the entrance. Eight long, writhing tentacles dangle from its head like a nest of worms. It's already moving, dropping toward the party.

**No surprise** (d6 = 3 -- the torchlight caught the wet gleam of its body).

**Initiative!**
- Party: **3**
- Creature: **5**

**It's faster.**

The thing drops from the ceiling onto Aldric, tentacles lashing. No claws, no bite -- just those rubbery feelers whipping across his armor, his face, his hands, seeking bare skin.

| Creature | AC | HP | THAC0 | Attacks | Special |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|---------|
| Pale segmented thing | 7 [12] | **15** | 16 [+3] | 8 tentacles | Paralysis (save or frozen 2d4 turns), no damage |

### Combat: The Crawler

**Round 1 -- Creature Acts First**

**8 tentacle attacks vs Aldric (AC 3, Prot Evil gives foes -1, so it needs 14+):**

| Attack | Roll | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Tentacle 1 | 7 | Miss |
| Tentacle 2 | **16** | **Hit -- Save vs Paralysis** |
| Tentacle 3 | 11 | Miss |
| Tentacle 4 | **19** | **Hit -- Save vs Paralysis** |
| Tentacle 5 | 4 | Miss |
| Tentacle 6 | **14** | **Hit -- Save vs Paralysis** |
| Tentacle 7 | 9 | Miss |
| Tentacle 8 | 12 | Miss |

Three tentacles find flesh. Aldric's muscles seize --

**Save vs Paralysis (needs 13+ with Prot Evil):**
- Save 1: **15** -- he shakes it off!
- Save 2: **8** -- **FAILED.**

Aldric goes rigid mid-swing. His mace clatters to the floor. He topples backward like a felled tree, eyes wide open, jaw locked. **Paralysed for 5 turns.**

The creature coils over his body, tentacles probing toward his throat.

---

**Now the party acts.**

The passage behind them is only 5 feet wide. Aelindra is right behind where Aldric fell. Varro is behind her. The creature is sitting on top of Aldric in the cave entrance.

*Aelindra knows her elven blood resists this creature's touch. She can wade in without fear of paralysis. Varro cannot.*

> **Player:** She casts Magic Missile at the creature and Varro stabs it with sword.

**Round 1 -- Party's Turn**

Aelindra doesn't hesitate. She extends her hand over Aldric's rigid body and speaks a single word of power. A bolt of crackling blue force streaks from her fingertips and punches into the creature's flank.

**Magic Missile:** Auto-hit. Damage: 1d6+1 = **5.** (Creature: 15 -> 10 HP)

The thing shrieks -- a wet, gurgling sound -- and rears up, tentacles flailing. Varro is already moving, squeezing past Aelindra into the wider cavern, circling right, and driving his sword into the creature's segmented body.

**Varro attacks:** d20 = **14** vs AC 7. Hit! Damage: 1d8 = **6.** (Creature: 10 -> 4 HP)

Pale ichor sprays across the stone. The creature writhes, dragging itself off Aldric, tentacles lashing blindly.

---

**Round 2 -- Initiative**
- Party: **5**
- Creature: **2**

**Party acts first!**

Aelindra draws her sword, steps over Aldric's frozen body, and brings the blade down on the wounded creature. She's immune to those tentacles and she knows it.

**Aelindra attacks:** d20 = **16** +1 (STR) = **17** vs AC 7. Hit! Damage: 1d8+1 = **4.** (Creature: 4 -> **0 HP**)

The blade bites deep between two segments. The creature convulses once, twice, and goes still. Its tentacles twitch and curl inward like dying roots.

---

### Combat Over

Varro puts a boot on the carcass and pulls it off Aldric. The cleric lies on his back, eyes open and aware but completely frozen, his mouth locked in a half-formed prayer. He'll be fine -- but not for another **4 turns**.

*"Four turns staring at the ceiling,"* Varro says, cleaning his blade. *"Could be worse. Could be dead."*

Aelindra kneels beside Aldric. *"He can hear us. Aldric -- blink twice if you're in pain."* Two slow, deliberate blinks. She nods. *"We'll get you sorted. Sit tight."* She allows herself a thin smile. *"Not that you have a choice."*

---

The cavern is quiet now. The cold draft still whistles through the crack in the far wall. Torchlight plays across the uneven floor. Now that the creature is dead, the rest of the space is visible:

- **Against the west wall:** A jumble of old bones, scraps of rusted armor, and what looks like a **leather satchel**, partially buried under rubble. Previous victims of the creature, long dead.
- **The crack in the far wall** is too narrow to pass through, but the draft suggests open space beyond -- perhaps connected to the surface somewhere above.
- **The ceiling** has no more surprises. Just stalactites and moisture.

**XP earned:** 75 (Carcass Crawler)

---

## The Satchel

> **Player:** Have the thief grab the satchel and search it.

Varro picks through the rubble carefully, pulling bones aside. Two skeletons -- old, picked clean long ago. Previous meals.

**Varro checks the satchel for traps.** (Find Traps: 20%)
Roll: **85.** He doesn't detect any traps. He unbuckles it.

*"Well now,"* he breathes. *"Whoever this poor sod was, they came prepared."*

The leather is cracked but the satchel held together. Inside:

- **1,000 gold coins** -- stamped with a lord's face none of them recognize. Old mint, good weight.

He turns to the skeletons and starts checking fingers, necks, wrists.

- **A gold necklace set with amber** on the first skeleton. Fine craftsmanship.
- **A silver bracelet inlaid with a dark red stone** on the second. Heavier than it looks.

Scattered around the bones are thousands of old, tarnished copper coins -- hardly worth the weight.

**Treasure Found:**

| Item | Value | Weight |
|------|-------|--------|
| Gold coins | 1,000gp | 1,000cn |
| Amber necklace | ~900gp | 10cn |
| Ruby bracelet | ~1,200gp | 10cn |
| Tarnished copper (3,000cp) | 30gp | 3,000cn |

**Total value: 3,130gp** (if all carried)

Varro holds the bracelet up to the torchlight. The ruby catches the flame and throws red light across the cavern wall.

*"The coppers aren't worth hauling. Thirty gold for three thousand coins of weight? Leave them."* He tucks the necklace and bracelet into his belt pouch and gestures at the gold. *"The satchel holds the gold fine, but that's a heavy bag. Someone's going to be slow."*

---

## Turns 8-10 -- Dividing the Spoils

> **Player:** Split the gold up to not excessively encumber any one person. Light another torch.

The party divides the gold while Aldric stares at the ceiling.

**Gold split: 334 / 333 / 333 gp**

| Character | Equipment | Gold | Jewellery | Total Weight | Movement |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Aldric | 840cn | 334cn | -- | **1,174cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Aelindra | 860cn | 333cn | -- | **1,193cn** | **30'(10')** |
| Varro | 555cn | 333cn | 20cn | **908cn** | **30'(10')** |

*"We're loaded down,"* Varro says, testing the weight of his pack. *"No outrunning anything now."*

The whole party is at **30' per turn exploring, 10' per round in combat.** Evasion will be difficult if something nasty shows up.

Aelindra lights **Torch #3** from the dying end of #2 and jams the fresh one into a crack in the wall, giving the cavern better light while they rest.

**Waiting for Aldric to recover (3 turns)...**

**Wandering monster check -- Turn 8:** d6 = **4.** Clear.
**Wandering monster check -- Turn 10:** d6 = **3.** Clear.

The three turns of rest also clears any fatigue penalty from continuous exploration. The cavern is a dead-end with only one way in, so they could hear anything coming.

At last, Aldric groans. His fingers twitch. He rolls onto his side, coughing.

*"Never again,"* he mutters, flexing feeling back into his hands. He retrieves his mace and hauls himself to his feet, testing his legs. Shaky, but functional.

---

**Party Status (Turn 10):**

| Name | HP | AC | Spells | MV |
|------|-----|-----|--------|-----|
| Aldric | 14/17 | 3 [16] | CLW | 30'(10') |
| Aelindra | 11/11 | 3 [16] | Sleep, Mirror Image | 30'(10') |
| Varro | 9/9 | 5 [14] | -- | 30'(10') |

**Prot from Evil:** Expired.
**Light:** Torch #3 (5 turns remaining). 9 torches left.
**Treasure carried:** 1,000gp + 2,100gp jewellery = **3,100gp value**

Still unexplored: the **glinting western chamber** through the archway, and those three undead behind the **spiked door** to the east (with their treasure hoard).

---

## The Retreat

> **Player:** We slowly start retracing our steps back out to the exit. We can't really carry any more gold.

The best adventurers know when to leave.

### Turn 11 -- The Pit

Back through the cavern, single file. The rope is still spiked at the pit's edge. Varro goes first, climbing down into the pit and up the other side, then braces the rope for the others. Aelindra crosses next. Aldric last, moving stiffly, armor scraping against the stone walls.

**Wandering monster check:** d6 = **5.** Clear.

### Turn 12 -- The Spiked Door

The party moves north through the narrow passage back to the T-intersection. As they turn east toward the entrance corridor, they pass the spiked door.

From behind it -- silence. Then the scrape of claws on stone. They heard the footsteps.

**WHAM.** The door shudders. A long, rattling hiss bleeds through the wood. **WHAM.** The spikes grind against the flagstone but hold firm.

*"Keep moving,"* Aelindra whispers.

**Wandering monster check:** d6 = **4.** Clear.

### Turn 13 -- Daylight

The entrance stairs. Thirty steps up, the air warming with every stride, the smell of earth and rain replacing the tomb's cold rot. Late afternoon sunlight pours down the stairway, blindingly bright after hours underground.

The party emerges onto the hillside. Gallows Hill stretches below them, the village of Harrow's End visible in the distance, smoke rising from chimneys. The wind is warm. Birds are singing.

They're alive, and they're rich.

### Treasure

**3,100gp value** (1,000gp coins + 900gp amber necklace + 1,200gp ruby bracelet)

After paying Marda's village nothing (they said keep what you find), the party has serious coin. Enough to resupply, hire a retainer or two, and buy that ten-foot pole.

### Unfinished Business

The tomb isn't cleared. The undead behind the spiked door are still there. The western chamber is untouched. And somewhere deeper, Valdros the Pale waits in whatever passes for his final rest. The livestock killings will continue until the job is finished.

But that's a problem for next session. Tonight, the Crooked Nail has warm ale and a fire.
