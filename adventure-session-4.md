## Preparation

### Shopping at Henk's Trading Post

> **Player:** Hit the shop, see if anything is available that would help with the undead.

Henk's shelves are thin. No holy water -- the party cleaned him out last session and the nearest monastery is two days' ride.

**Available stock:**

| Item | Stock | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Torches | plenty | 1gp/6 |
| Oil flasks | 4 | 2gp each |
| Iron spikes (12) | 1 bag | 1gp |
| Rope, 50' | 1 | 1gp |
| Garlic | several bulbs | 5gp |
| Wooden stakes & mallet | 3 stakes | 3gp |
| Wolfsbane | 1 sprig | 10gp |
| Holy water | 0 | -- |

No silver weapons. Nothing fancy. This is a village.

> **Player:** Buy oil flasks -- 3 for Varro, 4 for Bron.

Only 4 in stock. Split 2 and 2.

**Purchases:**

| Buyer | Item | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| Varro | Oil flasks x2 | 4gp |
| Bron | Oil flasks x2 | 4gp |
| **Total** | | **8gp** |

Varro: 3 oil flasks total (1 remaining + 2 new). Bron: 2 oil flasks.
Torches: ~18 in stock from previous sessions. No purchase needed.

**Marching Order:** Varro (pole, torch) -- Aldric & Bron (side by side) -- Aelindra (rear)

---

## Turn 1 -- Descent

Midmorning. Grey sky, light drizzle. The party descends into the tomb for the fifth time. Familiar steps, familiar corridor, familiar dust.

The T-intersection. To the east: the spiked door, two iron spikes at the base. To the west: cleared passages. North: the stairs to daylight.

No sound from behind the door. No sound from anywhere.

**Light:** Torch #1 (6 turns remaining)

---

## Turn 2 -- The Spiked Door

> **Player:** Repeat the same play as last time. The elf uses infravision to sneak up and quietly remove the spikes. The cleric storms the door and turns undead. Everybody else waits back at the intersection with the light source.

Aelindra moves alone into the dark. Infravision picks up cold stone, cold air. No heat signatures through the wood.

She kneels at the base of the door.

**Quiet spike removal (d20-under-DEX 15):**
- Spike 1: **8.** Slow, even pressure. A faint scrape. Nothing reacts.
- Spike 2: **14.** Tighter. She rocks it twice. A grinding sound -- then it pops free.

She sets both spikes down, steps to the side of the doorframe, and raises her hand.

Three fingers. Two. One.

---

### Aldric Charges

Three strides. Shield forward. He hits the door with his shoulder and it swings inward. Torchlight floods the burial vault.

Three grey shapes. One atop a sarcophagus. Two in the center of the room, hunched over the old remains of a deer carcass picked clean to bone. Six hollow eyes fix on the doorway. Jaws open. Hissing starts.

Holy symbol high. One word, spoken with a certainty he didn't have at Level 3.

**Turn Undead!** Level 4 Cleric vs Ghoul (2*): **Automatic success.**

**HD turned:** 2d6 = **8.** Three ghouls = 6 HD total. **All three turned.**

The hissing cuts off. All three recoil violently. One throws itself bodily over a sarcophagus and presses flat against the far wall. The other two scramble into the northwest corner, clawing over each other, faces averted from the blazing silver light.

The burial vault: 30 feet deep, 20 wide. Three open sarcophagi along the far wall. The ghouls are jammed into the far corner, cowering.

---

### Round 1

> **Player:** The cleric continues turning. The fighter and thief light them up with thrown oil flasks. The elf is ready with the magic sword -- only she can safely engage in melee.

**Varro -- Oil Flask (lit)** at the nearest ghoul
d20 = **16** + DEX +2, short range +1 = **19** vs AC 6. **Hit!**
Damage: 1d8 = **4.**

Fire blooms across grey skin. The creature shrieks and thrashes against the wall but won't turn around -- won't face Aldric's light.

**Bron -- Oil Flask (lit)** at the second ghoul
d20 = **13** + short range +1 = **14** vs AC 6. **Hit!**
Damage: 1d8 = **5.**

The second creature erupts in flame, clawing at itself. Two of three burning. The third is sandwiched between them, untouched but panicking.

**End of Round 1 -- Burning oil:**
- Ghoul #1: 1d8 = **3.** 7 → **4 HP.**
- Ghoul #2: 1d8 = **6.** 2 → **-4 HP. Dead.**

---

### Round 2

> **Player:** The elf targets one with Magic Missile. The fighter and thief throw their second oil flasks.

**Aelindra -- Magic Missile** at the unharmed ghoul
Auto-hit. Damage: 1d6+1 = **4.**

The bolt punches through its shoulder. It stumbles into the burning corpse of its companion.

**Varro -- Oil Flask (lit)** at the same ghoul
d20 = **11** + DEX +2, short range +1 = **14** vs AC 6. **Hit!**
Damage: 1d8 = **7.**

Fire engulfs it.

**Ghoul #3: 9 → 5 → -2 HP. Dead.**

**Bron -- Oil Flask (lit)** at the last burning ghoul
d20 = **9** + short range +1 = **10** vs AC 6. **Miss.**

The flask sails past and shatters against the far wall.

**End of Round 2 -- Burning oil (continued) on Ghoul #1:**
1d8 = **5.** 4 → **-1 HP. Dead.**

---

### Combat Over

Three blackened shapes lie in the far corner, motionless. Greasy smoke curls toward the ceiling. Aldric lowers his holy symbol.

---

## Searching the Room

> **Player:** The elf and thief search the room. The elf searches the north and east walls, the thief searches the south and west. The cleric and fighter look around the center.

**Aelindra -- North and East walls:**
Search for secret doors (2-in-6): d6 = **4.** Solid stone. Nothing hidden.

**Varro -- South and West walls:**
Find Traps (25%): d100 = **67.** Nothing detected.
Deep claw marks on the south wall from the ghouls. Otherwise solid.

**Aldric and Bron -- Center:**
The three sarcophagi still hold stacks of **tarnished silver coins** -- the 3,000sp left behind in Session 2. Untouched.

On the floor, scattered among the deer bones and scraps: **human remains.** Two sets. Recent -- weeks old, not centuries. The flesh gnawed clean. Mixed in with the debris: a **woodcutter's hatchet** with a notched blade, a scrap of rough homespun cloth, a **leather belt with a copper buckle**, and a single hobnail boot.

Bron went very still.

> **Player:** The elf asks Bron if those look familiar.

Bron crouched down. He picked up the hatchet, turned it over. His thumb found a mark on the handle -- initials carved into the wood.

*"That's Edric's. He carved his mark into the handle when we were boys so our uncle wouldn't mix up our tools."*

He looked at the boot, the belt. Didn't touch them.

*"The other one's probably Wil. They came up here together."*

He stood. His jaw was set. He didn't say anything else.

> **Player:** The elf gives him a hug and says, "I'm sorry for your loss." The cleric says a blessing followed by "No time to waste, the longer we stay here the more chance we get caught by surprise!" He starts leading the party out of the room.

Bron nodded once. He picked up Edric's hatchet and tucked it into his belt. He left the rest.

Aldric murmured a prayer over the bones. Then he straightened up, shield forward, and moved for the door.

---

## Turn 3 -- The T-Intersection

**Wandering monster check (Turn 2):** d6 = **5.** Clear.

Back at the junction. The east passage open behind them, smoke drifting out. The tomb was quiet. Everything encountered across four expeditions -- dead or destroyed.

> **Player:** Leave the silver. Now that the crypt is clear we can have people in town come to recover it. Exit and head back to town to notify everyone the undead have been eliminated.

---

## Turn 4 -- Daylight

**Wandering monster check:** d6 = **3.** Clear.

The party emerged onto Gallows Hill under a grey afternoon sky. For the first time, nothing waited below.

Bron looked back at the entrance. His hand rested on Edric's hatchet.

---

## Harrow's End

The half-day walk back was uneventful. Word traveled fast -- by the time the party reached the Crooked Nail, Marda was standing in the doorway.

*"Is it done?"*

The common room went quiet. A dozen villagers watching.

> **Player:** The cleric says, "It is done. The foul undead that resided there will trouble you no more. 3,000 silver is there with no danger left to retrieve it. This is our gift to the town. Send a few men to retrieve it and use the money to help those who need it most!"

Marda exhaled slowly.

*"Three thousand silver... We gave you three silver coins and you're giving back a thousand times that."*

She turned to the room. *"I need four strong backs and a cart up that hill at first light."*

The room erupted. Chairs scraped. Voices overlapped. Someone slapped Aldric on the shoulder. Someone else was already pouring ale. A woman near the back was crying quietly with relief.

Marda turned back to the party, quieter now.

*"The two woodcutters -- Edric and Wil. Did you find anything?"*

She was looking at Bron.

> **Player:** The elf is holding back tears. "We're sorry. Bron, do you want to tell her?"

Bron pulled the hatchet from his belt and held it out.

*"We found them. What was left of them."*

He set the hatchet on the table.

*"The things in the tomb got them. They're at rest now. The cleric said words over them."*

Marda picked up the hatchet, turned it over, saw the mark on the handle. She closed her eyes and nodded.

*"I'll tell their families."*

She set the hatchet down gently.

*"You've done more for this village than anyone has in my lifetime. Drinks are on the house tonight. Every night you're here."*

---

## Evening -- The Crooked Nail

> **Player:** We drink and relax with the people of the town and respectfully honor the dead, while telling the story of our adventure.

The fire was built up high. More villagers filtered in as word spread. The party told the story over ale and warm bread. Children sat on the floor by the fire, wide-eyed. Old men shook their heads at the parts about the ghouls. When the tale reached Valdros rising from his sarcophagus, the room went dead silent. When it ended with holy water shattering across his skull, someone cheered, and then everyone did.

A round was raised for Edric and Wil. Bron drank with their families. Quiet words were exchanged that weren't for anyone else to hear.

Later, when the fire burned low, Marda sat down with the party one last time. She slid three silver coins across the table -- the same three from the first night.

*"You never took our payment. Seems wrong that you shouldn't have it."*

The rain drummed softly on the roof. The Crooked Nail was warm.

The road goes ever on. Where it leads is up to them.
