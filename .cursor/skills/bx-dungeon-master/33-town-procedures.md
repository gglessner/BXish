# Town Procedures

## Town Loop (per turn)
1. Party picks destination or action
2. Roll contact/reaction (2d6+CHA mod)
3. Resolve the business
4. Tick one town turn
5. Trouble check: 1-in-6 (+1 loud/violent/flashing wealth, +1 dealing in hot goods, -1 laying low)
6. If trouble: introduce complication tied to law, factions, or scarcity
7. Update heat
8. Repeat until party leaves

## Town Turns
Each meaningful action = 1 town turn (~1 hour). Shopping, meeting contacts, carousing for rumors, visiting temple, hiring help, researching, casing a place. Laying low = multiple turns. Spells still track on dungeon time (10-min turns).

## Six Anchors
Prep 1 sentence each. Reusable across settlements with minor tweaks.

| Anchor | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|
| Inn/Tavern | Beds, gossip, meals, available trouble |
| Market | Gear availability, fences, scams, pickpockets |
| Temple | Healing, curses, moral leverage, donations |
| Authority | Guards, law, courts, permits, bribes, jail |
| Specialist | Sage, alchemist, wizard, shipmaster, trainer |
| Shady Option | Thieves' guild, smugglers, black market |

## Three Pressures
Pick 3 per town:
- **Faction:** Who's in conflict? What does each faction want?
- **Law:** How strict, how corrupt, how competent?
- **Scarcity:** What's hard to get? (healing, silver, privacy, spare time, food)

## Heat Track (0-5)
Tracks how much attention the party has attracted. Starts at 0.

**Heat rises:** Obvious crimes, flashing wealth, public violence, caught lying to authority, selling suspicious treasure, insulting powerful locals.
**Heat falls:** Lay low for a day, spend money quietly, make donations, do a favor for a faction, leave town for a while.

| Heat | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 0-1 | Normal -- people are friendly or indifferent |
| 2-3 | Watched, followed, questioned. Prices rise |
| 4 | Warrants, raids, informants, bounty hunters |
| 5 | Fight out or dragged to court |

Heat doesn't punish instantly -- it changes the kind of town the DM is running.

## NPCs
Role first, name later. Name them only when they become important to play.

| Role Examples |
|---------------|
| Innkeeper, watch sergeant, fence, temple priest, brewer who hears everything, clerk who stamps permits |

Run each NPC with three checks:
1. **Reaction** (2d6+CHA mod) -- determines initial disposition
2. **Motivation** -- profit, safety, status, revenge, faith
3. **Morale** -- when threatened: fold, run, call guards, or set up retaliation later

## Rumors
Each rumor is bait, warning, or both. Three types:
1. **Information** -- something the party didn't know
2. **Opportunity** -- a way to profit or solve a problem
3. **Cost** -- someone wants a cut, a favor, or a price paid later

## Town Trouble (when check hits)
Trouble in town is rarely combat. It's complications tied to prepped pressures:
- Guard asking questions
- Rival buyer making a suspicious offer
- Innkeeper demanding payment upfront
- Rumor spreading about the party
- Temple noticing that idol/treasure looks familiar
- Faction sending watchers -- not attacking, just watching who talks to who

## Selling Treasure
Don't narrate receipts. Run it through the loop:
1. Pick a buyer (market, fence, specialist, shady)
2. Reaction roll -- determines price and friction
3. Buyer asks one question that creates tension (e.g., "Where'd you get it?")
4. Party response determines consequence: lie poorly, tell truth, refuse, flash it around
5. Tick a town turn, check trouble

## Quick Town Prep (Index Card)
**Side 1:**
- Name + vibe (1 sentence)
- Law: strict / fair / corrupt / weak
- Scarcity: what's hard to get
- Factions: up to 3, each with a 1-sentence goal
- Six anchors: 1 sentence each

**Side 2:**
- Town turn length (1 hour default)
- Trouble check: 1-in-6 modified by behavior
- Heat track: 0-5
- One unique problem (not a plot -- a problem)

### Unique Problem Examples
- Counterfeit coins in circulation
- Well water making people sick
- Noble missing, guards desperate
- New preacher calling adventurers demons
- Someone is buying bodies
- Caravan hit on the east road, survivors came back wrong
