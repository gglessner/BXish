# Town Procedures

## The Home Base Rule
One town should be THE anchor for the campaign -- the place the party returns to between expeditions. This creates the campaign loop: go out → take risks → come back → recover → spend → level → hear rumors → choose the next lead. That loop is the engine. Without it, a sandbox feels like random wandering.

**Safe means steady, not immune.** Inside the home base, no wilderness attrition pressure -- no random encounter rolls every hour, no starvation, no getting lost. But safe does NOT mean no thieves, no scams, no factions, no consequences. If the party makes enemies, those enemies lean on the town (bribes, spies, rumors, road traps). If the party clears a nearby ruin, the road gets safer, prices drop, the inn gets busier.

**Town as scoreboard.** The home base should physically reflect the campaign's progress. Party success improves the town. Party failures or enemies degrade it. The players can SEE their impact when they walk through the gate.

**The safety line.** Draw one clear boundary: inside walls = steady rest and town procedures. Outside = wilderness/dungeon game procedures. If everything is equally dangerous all the time, players use towns as pit stops and the campaign feels like a series of errands.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Wandering between equivalent settlements (same menu of services, different paint) kills campaign gravity. ONE town is home.
- Making the home base immune to change kills emotional investment. Players come back to refill torches but not because it's home.

**Rumor construction:** Prep 6 rumors for the home base. 2 true, 2 half-true, 2 false. This gives players real choices and teaches them to verify information. Refresh as leads are followed or time passes.

## Town Loop (per turn)
1. Party picks destination or action
2. Roll contact/reaction (2d6+CHA mod)
3. Resolve the business
4. Tick one town turn
5. Trouble check: 1-in-6 (+1 loud/violent/flashing wealth, +1 dealing in hot goods, -1 laying low)
6. If trouble: introduce complication tied to law, factions, or scarcity
7. Update heat
8. Repeat until party leaves

## Town Turns
Each meaningful action = 1 town turn (~1 hour). Shopping, meeting contacts, carousing for rumors, visiting temple, hiring help, researching, casing a place. Laying low = multiple turns. Spells still track on dungeon time (10-min turns).

## Six Anchors
Prep 1 sentence each. Reusable across settlements with minor tweaks.

| Anchor | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|
| Inn/Tavern | Beds, gossip, meals, available trouble |
| Market | Gear availability, fences, scams, pickpockets |
| Temple | Healing, curses, moral leverage, donations |
| Authority | Guards, law, courts, permits, bribes, jail |
| Specialist | Sage, alchemist, wizard, shipmaster, trainer |
| Shady Option | Thieves' guild, smugglers, black market |

## Three Pressures
Pick 3 per town:
- **Faction:** Who's in conflict? What does each faction want?
- **Law:** How strict, how corrupt, how competent?
- **Scarcity:** What's hard to get? (healing, silver, privacy, spare time, food)

## Heat Track (0-5)
Tracks how much attention the party has attracted. Starts at 0.

**Heat rises:** Obvious crimes, flashing wealth, public violence, caught lying to authority, selling suspicious treasure, insulting powerful locals.
**Heat falls:** Lay low for a day, spend money quietly, make donations, do a favor for a faction, leave town for a while.

| Heat | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 0-1 | Normal -- people are friendly or indifferent |
| 2-3 | Watched, followed, questioned. Prices rise |
| 4 | Warrants, raids, informants, bounty hunters |
| 5 | Fight out or dragged to court |

Heat doesn't punish instantly -- it changes the kind of town the DM is running.

## NPCs
Role first, name later. Name them only when they become important to play.

| Role Examples |
|---------------|
| Innkeeper, watch sergeant, fence, temple priest, brewer who hears everything, clerk who stamps permits |

Run each NPC with three checks:
1. **Reaction** (2d6+CHA mod) -- determines initial disposition
2. **Motivation** -- profit, safety, status, revenge, faith
3. **Morale** -- when threatened: fold, run, call guards, or set up retaliation later

## Rumors
Each rumor is bait, warning, or both. Three types:
1. **Information** -- something the party didn't know
2. **Opportunity** -- a way to profit or solve a problem
3. **Cost** -- someone wants a cut, a favor, or a price paid later

## Town Trouble (when check hits)
Trouble in town is rarely combat. It's complications tied to prepped pressures:
- Guard asking questions
- Rival buyer making a suspicious offer
- Innkeeper demanding payment upfront
- Rumor spreading about the party
- Temple noticing that idol/treasure looks familiar
- Faction sending watchers -- not attacking, just watching who talks to who

## Selling Treasure
Don't narrate receipts. Run it through the loop:
1. Pick a buyer (market, fence, specialist, shady)
2. Reaction roll -- determines price and friction
3. Buyer asks one question that creates tension (e.g., "Where'd you get it?")
4. Party response determines consequence: lie poorly, tell truth, refuse, flash it around
5. Tick a town turn, check trouble

## Quick Town Prep (Index Card)
**Side 1:**
- Name + vibe (1 sentence)
- Law: strict / fair / corrupt / weak
- Scarcity: what's hard to get
- Factions: up to 3, each with a 1-sentence goal
- Six anchors: 1 sentence each

**Side 2:**
- Town turn length (1 hour default)
- Trouble check: 1-in-6 modified by behavior
- Heat track: 0-5
- One unique problem (not a plot -- a problem)

### Unique Problem Examples
- Counterfeit coins in circulation
- Well water making people sick
- Noble missing, guards desperate
- New preacher calling adventurers demons
- Someone is buying bodies
- Caravan hit on the east road, survivors came back wrong
