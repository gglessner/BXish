# Treasure Design -- Treasure That Forces Hard Choices

## Core Principle
Good treasure is **valuable and inconvenient.** If the best loot fits in a pocket, you've removed half the game. Encumbrance becomes fiction, hirelings never matter, retreat routes don't matter. When loot is awkward, everything wakes up -- treasure isn't the end of the scene, it's the start of the next one.

## The Quick Test
When placing treasure, ask four questions:

| Question | If No |
|----------|-------|
| Does this change their **movement**? | They walk out at full speed -- no tension |
| Does this change their **time**? | No extra turns, no extra wandering monster checks |
| Does this change their **risk**? | No trade-offs, no hard choices |
| Does this change what happens in **town**? | Treasure is a vending machine, not gameplay |

If the answer is no to all four, it's clean coin. Fine sometimes -- but if everything is clean coin, treasure stops being gameplay and becomes accounting.

## Four Treasure Categories

### 1. Big Bulk -- Forces a Plan
Treasure that requires logistics, not just a line on the sheet.

- Solid silver idol: two people to carry, loud, heavy, impossible to hide
- Rolled tapestry in a case: worth a fortune intact, worth scraps if torn, soaked, or smoked
- Stone lid with rune inlay: valuable if you can transport a slab through a dungeon
- Coffer of trade bars in a flooded chamber: heavy, slippery, time-consuming to drain or haul wet

The table starts doing its job: *Who carries it? What do we drop? Do we go back the way we came? Do we hire porters next time? Do we risk a second trip?*

### 2. Proof and Paperwork -- Social Risk
Value locked behind identity, legitimacy, or dangerous knowledge.

- Sealed letter of credit from a dead merchant: worth a fortune if you can prove entitlement -- proving things means talking to people who might hang you
- Map case with a noble crest: selling it is a confession, keeping it is an invitation
- Deed to land in disputed territory: valuable on paper, explosive in practice
- Sealed orders with a faction seal: intelligence worth more than gold, but possessing it is treason

### 3. Hot Items -- Everyone Wants It
Recognizable, desirable, dangerous to hold.

- Jeweled holy symbol from a rival faith: fence it, return it, or keep it -- it's a political grenade
- Signet ring from a missing noble house: not jewelry, proof of something. Proof is dangerous
- Dwarven weapon with a maker's mark: dwarves care. A lot
- Coins with a stamp nobody recognizes: any merchant who sees them will ask questions you don't want to answer

### 4. Route-Changers -- Alters the Exit
If hauling it means you can't retreat the safe way, you've created a new problem without rolling a single extra die.

- Too heavy for the rope climb
- Too wide for the narrow passage
- Too fragile for the trapped corridor
- Too loud for the stealth route past the sleeping ogre

## Treasure Fights Your Resources
Hauling treasure competes with the things that keep you alive:

| Resource | How Treasure Fights It |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Time** | Extra turns hauling = extra wandering monster checks |
| **Light** | Slower movement burns torches faster |
| **Speed** | Encumbered party can't outrun pursuit |
| **Stealth** | Heavy/loud treasure announces your position |
| **Spells** | Burning a spell slot on Floating Disc means one fewer combat spell |
| **Hands** | Carrying treasure means weapons not drawn |

## Resale Is Gameplay
If every town has a friendly merchant who gives full value for anything, treasure is a vending machine. Make selling part of the adventure.

**Coins are anonymous. Unique treasure is not.**

When the party asks "who buys this?" -- that's gameplay happening:
- Sell fast (half value, no questions)
- Sell quiet (full value, takes time, risk of word spreading)
- Sell open (full value, everyone knows you're rich now)
- Return it (no gold, but a favor, an ally, information)
- Keep it (ongoing risk, but ongoing leverage)

## Town Heat from Treasure
Walking into a backwater village looking like you hit the jackpot is not subtle. Somebody talks, somebody watches, somebody follows. Connect to [33-town-procedures.md](33-town-procedures.md) heat track:

- Flashing expensive loot in a poor town: +1 heat
- Selling faction property openly: +2 heat
- Disposing of recognizable noble goods: heat + specific faction attention

Treasure turns town into part two of the adventure.

## Running It Fair
When they find the loot, don't play coy. Say the important parts out loud:
- "This is heavy -- two people to carry, and you'll be slow"
- "This is fragile -- one bad fall and it's worthless"
- "This will draw attention in town -- it has a crest on it"
- "This will be hard to sell openly"

You're not punishing them. You're giving them a real decision.

**Let them take part.** If the party grabs the gems and leaves the bronze statue, that's not failure -- that's smart play. The dungeon is a place with layers, not a checklist.

## Why Hirelings and Mules Finally Matter
If treasure always fits in pockets, the party never needs labor. Design treasure that requires:
- Porters for bulk
- Mules for weight
- Carts for distance
- Guards for the trip home

The party that never needs labor will never hire labor. And hirelings who carry your fortune become people you depend on -- and people who know where the money is.
