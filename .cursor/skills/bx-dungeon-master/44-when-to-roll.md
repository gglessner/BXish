# When to Roll -- The Ruling Framework

## Core Rule
Roll only when the outcome is **uncertain**, failure is **interesting**, and **time or pressure** matters. If any of those three are missing, you usually don't roll -- you just play it out.

Dice are a resolution tool, not a content generator. The DM's job isn't to hand players the world through skill checks. It's to present a world they interact with.

## The Three-Question Test
Before any roll, ask:

| Question | If No |
|----------|-------|
| **Is the outcome actually uncertain?** | Obviously works = auto-success. Obviously fails = explain why + offer a handle |
| **Is failure interesting?** | If failure = "nothing happens, try again" = don't roll. That's repetition, not drama |
| **Does time or pressure matter?** | No time pressure = players can brute force anything. Don't roll, just charge time |

All three must be yes for a roll to matter. Otherwise, pick one of the other outcomes.

## Four Outcomes (Not Just "Roll or Don't")

### 1. It Just Works
The method is reasonable and specific. Player skill gets rewarded. Game moves on.

"I check the threshold on the hinge side and run the 10-foot pole along the floor." -- Give them what they find. No roll.

### 2. It Just Doesn't Work
Impossible, but explain why and offer a handle.

"That won't work because the hinges are on the interior. But you could try spikes, force, or find another way around." Don't dead-end the players -- redirect them.

### 3. It Works, But Costs Time
The action succeeds, but it takes a turn (or more). Torch burns, wandering monster check, noise carries. The choice matters without dice.

"Sure, you can search the whole room, but that's two turns. You'll burn a torch segment and I'm checking for wandering monsters." Now it's a real decision.

### 4. Roll
It's uncertain, failure changes the situation, and the clock is ticking or danger is present. This is where dice belong.

Failure on a roll should never mean "nothing happens, try again." It means the situation changes: the trap fires, noise alerts the dungeon, you're spotted, the door makes a racket, time is lost and something heard you.

## "Tell Me What You're Doing, Not What You're Rolling"
This one sentence retrains players to interact with the world instead of the character sheet. Follow up with:
- Where exactly?
- How exactly?
- What tool are you using?
- How long are you spending?

Now you're back to exploration play, not character sheet play.

## The No "Try Again" Rule
If a roll can be repeated with no risk, don't roll. The biggest fix for skill check spam.

A failed action must result in one of:
- **Success at a cost** -- it works, but now it cost time, noise, or resources
- **Changed situation** -- the failure altered something (trap fires partially, alarm raised, approach blocked)
- **New approach required** -- the same method won't work again; try something different

"Roll until I win" is not tension. It's grinding out success. If there's no consequence for failure, there's no reason to roll.

## Common Dungeon Situations

### Searching a Room
**"I search the room"** -- broad. It works, but costs 2-3 turns with wandering monster checks.

**"I look behind the books on the shelf"** -- specific. No roll. You find the scrape marks. One shelf swings open.

**"I search the room for secret doors"** -- the 1-in-6 roll exists for finding things that are specifically hidden beyond normal observation. But specific investigation of the right area should auto-succeed or improve odds.

### Stuck Doors
The open doors roll is for getting it open **quickly and quietly**. Fail doesn't mean it stays shut forever.

Failure = the door still opens, but it costs a full turn and makes significant noise. No more rolls. The consequence is time and attention, not permanent failure.

### Listening at a Door
If there's something audible, give it to them. Fighter presses ear to the door -- tell them what's there (muffled voices, dripping, silence).

Roll only when it's uncertain AND pressured: chaos echoing through halls, time constraint from a nearby patrol, competing noise sources.

### Forcing / Breaking Things
If the party has time and tools, it works. It just costs turns and makes noise.

Roll only when: under fire, limited time, risky consequences (collapsing ceiling, alerting the level, breaking something valuable on the other side).

### Climbing
With rope, spikes, harness, and time = no roll. It's a time cost.

Roll when: being shot at, floor collapsing, total darkness, sheer wall with no equipment (thief ability), or time pressure.

### Sneaking
Failure isn't "you're caught, combat starts." Failure is graduated:
- Spotted at a distance (they know someone is here)
- Heard but not seen (alarm raised, but you have a head start)
- Encounter begins on bad footing (they're wary, you lost surprise)

### Trap Disarming
See [34-trap-procedures.md](34-trap-procedures.md) for the full Intent→Information→Roll procedure. Same philosophy applies: specific method with smart tools = auto-success. Roll only when pressured, improvised, or the mechanism is complex.

## The Clean Default

| Player Action | DM Response |
|--------------|-------------|
| Specific + plausible | It works |
| Broad + sloppy | It works, but costs time |
| Dangerous or pressured | Roll |
| Impossible | Doesn't happen (explain why, offer a handle) |

This keeps the game moving and makes player skill -- not character skill -- matter.
