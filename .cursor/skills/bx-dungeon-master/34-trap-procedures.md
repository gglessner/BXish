# Trap Procedures

## Core Method: Intent → Information → Roll Only If Needed

### Step 1: Intent
"I check for traps" is not enough. Ask: **"Where exactly and with what method?"**

Players describe what they're looking for and how:
- "I'm watching the floor for pressure plates or uneven stones"
- "I'm checking the lock, lid seam, hinges -- any holes or needle channels"
- "I'm probing ahead with the 10-foot pole"
- "I'm looking for trip wires at ankle height around the handle"

Intent tells the DM what kind of clues to reveal.

### Step 2: Information
Respond with **clues, not answers.** Give actionable evidence that invites the next decision.

- "One flagstone is cleaner than the rest and sits a hair lower"
- "There's a faint scratch line around the lock plate, like it's been removed and reset"
- "The keyhole has a faint oily, bitter smell"
- "The door frame has two tiny holes on the inside; the stone around them is slightly discolored"
- "That section sounds hollow when you tap it"

Give clues in layers: one standout detail, one suspicious detail, one confirmation of safety elsewhere. Players should feel progress without getting the full blueprint.

### Step 3: Roll Only If Needed
The roll is never "does the trap exist?" The roll is **"what does it cost you?"**

Roll when:
- **Time matters** -- spending turns means wandering monster checks, torch burn, spell duration ticking
- **Precision matters** -- tiny mechanism, shaky hands, cramped space
- **Noise matters** -- need to disarm quietly vs metal scraping or stone grinding
- **Danger matters** -- failure triggers the trap

**Auto-success** when the method is solid: right tool, right approach, sufficient time, no pressure. Don't roll for what smart play already solves.

## Tools That Earn Real Information

| Tool | What It Reveals |
|------|----------------|
| 10-foot pole / spear butt | Press a stone: it sinks with a soft click. Probe a floor: something shifts |
| Chalk, flour, ash | Dust the floor: powder breaks into a rectangle where something moves |
| Mirror (on a rod) | Slide under a door: spot holes aligned with the latch |
| String | Tie to a handle, pull from cover -- trigger from safe distance |
| Iron spikes, wedges | Wedge a pressure plate so it can't depress. Spike a door open |
| Water or oil | Drizzle on a seam: pulled inward = airflow = hollow space behind |
| Listening / tapping | Tap with dagger pommel: hollow sound = pit or void |

If the player uses the right tool for the situation, give them real results -- not a roll.

## The Thief's Role
The thief skill (Find/Remove Traps) is a **niche, not a gate.**

- **Everyone** can investigate, bypass, and improvise solutions
- **The thief** gets the cleanest, fastest disarm -- especially for fine mechanisms (needle traps, poison locks, complex triggers)
- **Non-thieves** can try risky solutions: force it, wedge it, trigger from distance, rope-pull from cover, carry the chest out, flood the corridor

### When to Use Thief Skill
- Disarming a fine mechanism quickly and quietly
- Removing a trap without wrecking the lock or contents
- Working under time pressure when careful methods cost too many turns
- On failure: the trap likely triggers -- this is the risk the thief accepts for speed

## Making Time Visible
Say costs out loud:
- "That careful check costs a turn"
- "The disarm attempt will take a full turn"
- "Rushing it saves time but risks triggering it"
- "You can do it safely, but it takes a full turn and it's loud"

Players choose their own trouble when they understand the cost.

## Trap Design Principles
Traps exist to do three jobs:
1. **Make the dungeon feel engineered** -- somebody built this, somebody expects intruders
2. **Make time matter** -- searching is powerful but burns light, turns, and safety
3. **Force trade-offs** -- slow and safe vs fast and loud, risk blood vs spend resources, open it vs walk away

If a trap doesn't create a decision, it's just random damage.

## Common Trap Types and Player Options

### Pressure Plate (Hallway)
- **Clue:** One stone cleaner/lower than the rest
- **Options:** Wedge it down, jam the wall mechanism, trigger safely with pole, jump it, find another route
- **Roll for:** Rushing the wedge (might snap back)

### Needle Lock (Chest)
- **Clue:** Scratch line around lock plate, oily smell from keyhole
- **Options:** Rotate chest so lock faces away, work it with pole, hand it to the thief, carry it out unopened, force it (loud, may break contents)
- **Roll for:** Thief removing the mechanism (failure = trigger), forcing it (noise + breakage risk)

### Dart Holes (Door Frame)
- **Clue:** Tiny holes on inside of frame, discolored stone
- **Options:** Rope-pull from cover, shield wall, spike door open, jam holes with wax/clay, trigger and dodge
- **Roll for:** Jamming the mechanism without triggering (precision under pressure)

### Pit Trap (Corridor)
- **Clue:** Hollow sound when tapped, stone slightly different color/texture, pole causes a shift
- **Options:** Jump across, plank over, wedge the lid, trigger safely and climb down/up, find another route
- **Roll for:** Rushing across, wedging under time pressure
