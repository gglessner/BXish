# Three-Layer Encounters

## Core Idea
Every encounter gets three layers. Takes 3-5 sentences total to prep. Turns static rooms into living, reactive situations.

## The Three Layers

### Layer 1: Surface
What the players think is happening. The immediate sensory impression. **Clear, not clever.**

This is the hook the players grab onto. Their first understanding guides everything they do next.

### Layer 2: Truth
What's actually happening beneath the surface. The real situation.

This layer rewards observation, clever play, and curiosity. It creates a world that feels deeper than what's on the map.

### Layer 3: Sideways
What happens when things go wrong, dice go wild, or players do the unexpected. One sentence, maybe two.

Not a script -- just the natural momentum of the scene. Keeps encounters from feeling like static dioramas.

## Examples

### Kobold Sack
- **Surface:** Three small scaled creatures arguing over a torn sack
- **Truth:** They're not arguing -- they're terrified. Something bigger is hunting them
- **Sideways:** They flee toward the hunter, dragging the party into bigger trouble

### Wounded Ogre
- **Surface:** A wounded ogre slumped against a toppled idol
- **Truth:** He wasn't wounded by adventurers -- betrayed by his own tribe
- **Sideways:** He collapses mid-fight, turning a brawl into a moral dilemma

### Chest in the Light
- **Surface:** A dusty chamber with a single chest resting in a patch of light
- **Truth:** The chest isn't trapped -- it's bait set by goblins skulking in the rafters
- **Sideways:** The ambushers retreat into a crawl space, leaving clues the PCs can follow or ignore

### White Flag
- **Surface:** A lone goblin waving a dirty white cloth in a forest clearing
- **Truth:** He's not surrendering -- he's signaling his tribe to circle and flank
- **Sideways:** If chased or wounded, he flees toward a trapped deadfall he's terrified to cross

## How to Prep
Scribble it in your notebook. Three lines per encounter:

```
Room 4: Surface — [what they see]
         Truth  — [what's really going on]
         Sideways — [what happens when it tilts]
```

That's it. No novel. No stat block essay. Three layers, three sentences.

## Why This Works
- Encourages player-driven solutions (not scripted outcomes)
- Keeps the world reactive (it was moving before the party arrived)
- Makes even simple foes interesting (kobolds become a warning sign, not just XP)
- Lightens prep load (1-2 sentences per layer)
- Connects naturally to morale, reaction rolls, and procedural play
- Stops dungeons from feeling like disconnected rooms with wind-up toys inside

## Connection to Other Procedures
- **Layer 1** feeds directly into [35-telegraphing-danger.md](35-telegraphing-danger.md) -- the surface IS the sensory hook
- **Layer 2** is what observation, smart questions, and investigation reveal -- ties to [34-trap-procedures.md](34-trap-procedures.md) Intent→Information method
- **Layer 3** is what morale checks, failed reactions, and player chaos produce -- ties to combat morale and NPC motivation
