# Encounters & Evasion
## Surprise
Each unaware side 1d6: 1-2=surprised. Carrying light=can't surprise. Surprised side: other gets 1 free round (move+attack). After that, normal encounter flow.
**Use surprise for position, not just damage.** Best round-1 moves: control a doorway, set spears, create missile lanes, back out and close/spike the door, grab treasure and flee, or get the torchbearer behind the line. Position is power.
**Distance matters:** Surprise at 10' in a corridor = immediate contact. Surprise at 60' in a room = window of choices (formation, retreat, negotiation).
**Surprise doesn't mean combat.** If intelligent creatures are surprised and nobody attacks, roll reaction. Surprise controls the first words, not just the first swing -- bluff, parley, threaten, demand tribute from a strong position.
**Surprise triggers morale.** First-round shock (a monster drops, the line breaks, the leader is hit) often breaks morale early. Surprise → hit hard → morale check → fight ends fast.

**Wilderness** (fleeing group size vs pursuers):
1-4: 50%/70%/90% (1/2-3/4+ pursuers). 5-12: 35%/50%/70%. 13-24: 25%/35%/50%. 25+: 10%/25%/35%.
