# Faction Play -- The Sandbox Engine

## What Is a Faction?
A faction is what somebody wants plus the means to chase it. If they want something and nothing happens when they don't get it, that's not a faction -- that's scenery.

Factions make the world move when the players aren't looking. They're not politics. They're pressure. They're why goblins don't just stand in room 12 waiting to die. They're why the town has rumors that actually go somewhere.

## Faction Card Template
Five lines per faction. Write it on an index card.

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Short, memorable, usable at the table |
| **Want** | One sentence. What they want THIS WEEK, not their backstory |
| **Have** | One sentence. Soldiers, gold, magic, information, a monster, a chokepoint, the only clean well |
| **Fear** | One sentence. Fear creates urgency, urgency creates action, action creates play |
| **Tell** | How the players recognize them fast. River tattoos, lantern badges, sealed papers, clean boots on dock workers |

Then add:
- **One ally**
- **One enemy**
- **One job** they'd pay adventurers to do

That's it. You're 80% done.

## Factions Must Be Uneven
If every faction has the same strength, same visibility, same access -- it's a buffet. The party samples everything, nothing bites back.

**Make the differences matter:**
- One faction has muscle
- One has money
- One has leverage
- One is desperate

Don't balance them. The unevenness IS the gameplay. If the party helps the weak faction, the strong one retaliates. If the party exposes the corrupt one, the desperate one loses their enemy and maybe turns to banditry. If nothing changes, players learn their choices don't matter and start playing like a video game.

## Two Faction Moves Per Session
Between sessions, pick two factions that would logically act. Write one sentence each for what they do.

Examples:
- "The cult frames the goblins for the missing villagers"
- "The goblins steal the chapel key and hide it in the latrine"
- "The guild sends watchers to the inn -- not attacking, just noting who talks to who"
- "The tax man posts notices on every tavern door"

One sentence each. That's enough to change the dungeon or town when the party comes back. This is the living world people talk about, without writing a novel.

## Reaction Rolls as Faction Engine
When the party meets a faction group (guards, goblins, guild toughs), don't decide their mood -- roll reaction (2d6+CHA mod) and let the world surprise you.

**Hostile doesn't mean fight:**
- Threaten
- Shake down / demand tribute
- Escort out of territory
- Call for reinforcements as intimidation

**Friendly doesn't mean buddy:**
- "We can use you" (the most honest dungeon friendship)
- Offer a deal with strings
- Share information that serves THEIR interest
- Recruit the party against their enemy

## Morale Rolls for Faction Behavior
Morale tells you when a faction breaks, retreats, bargains, or lives to fight another day. This is how you get:
- Recurring enemies (they fled, they remember)
- Shifting alliances (they need new friends after a loss)
- Bargaining mid-fight ("Wait! We can pay!")
- Consequences that aren't just TPK or nothing

## Consequence Chains
When the party does something big (wipe out a leader, steal a relic, start a fire), factions react. Think one step ahead:

| Party Action | Faction Reactions |
|-------------|------------------|
| Help the goblins | Cult retaliates against the party or the goblins |
| Expose the cult | Goblins lose their enemy -- maybe turn to banditry |
| Steal the relic | Everyone wants the party. Some to pay, some to hang |
| Kill the guild leader | Power vacuum. Lieutenants fight, rivals move in |
| Do nothing | Factions advance their own plans. The party missed their window |

If choices don't produce consequences, players stop making meaningful ones.

## Clear, Not Clever
If the players can't tell what a group is about, they can't play off it. Make motives obvious and methods visible.

**Show in play, not in speeches:**
- A shaken shopkeeper (someone leaned on him)
- A sermon that names names without naming names
- A tax notice nailed to the tavern door
- River tattoos on the dockworkers who "don't know nothing"
- Clean-scrubbed temple volunteers asking pointed questions

You don't explain factions. You show what they do to the world around them.

## Dungeon Faction Example
Old ruined keep, three groups:

**Goblins (barracks):** Want food and safety. Have numbers, basic traps, best map of level 1. Fear the cult's "blessings" (goblins who don't come back). Tell: crude warning marks scratched on walls.

**Cult (chapel):** Want a relic under the keep. Have intimidation, charmed locals, a leader who can bargain. Fear exposure -- if the town connects them to disappearances, the militia comes hard. Tell: hooded robes, incense smell, clean hands in a filthy dungeon.

**Skeleton patrols (halls):** Not a faction -- pressure. The hazard both factions deal with. Wander on a schedule. Nobody controls them.

When the party arrives: goblins don't rush. A scout watches. The boss thinks "these idiots might be useful." They offer a deal: "We show secret door. You kill bone men." Now you're playing old-school -- the best treasure might come from a handshake, not a body count.

## Town Faction Example
Three powers pulling in different directions:

**Dockside Guild:** Want river trade control. Have money, smugglers, bribed officials. Fear the baron's new honest tax man. Tell: river tattoos, clean boots on dock workers. Ally: innkeeper. Enemy: tax man. Job: make the tax man disappear for a week.

**Temple of the Lantern:** Want to purge witchcraft from the old ruins. Have public trust, healing, a bell that calls volunteers. Fear scandal -- one ugly rumor and donations dry up. Tell: lantern badges, strict questions, clean hands. Ally: tax man (quietly). Enemy: smugglers. Job: bring proof the ruins are cursed.

**The Tax Man:** Wants to collect enough to keep his job and not get stabbed. Has legal authority, a few trained men, the baron's seal. Fears being alone at night. Tell: sealed papers, ink-stained fingers, nervous stare. Ally: temple. Enemy: guild. Job: escort me to the docks, I'm paying.

Drop the party in. If they help the tax man, the guild hates them but the temple approves. If they take guild money, the temple preaches against them. If they play clever, they set factions against each other and walk away with profit.

## Quick Prep Checklist
1. Three factions, five lines each (want, have, fear, tell + ally/enemy/job)
2. Make them uneven (muscle vs. money vs. leverage vs. desperate)
3. Two faction moves between sessions (one sentence each)
4. Use reaction rolls when the party meets faction members
5. Use morale rolls to decide when factions break, retreat, or bargain
6. Show faction motives through the environment, not exposition
