# Session Prep -- 20-Minute GM Audit

## Purpose
A structured pre-session checklist that fixes campaign drift, sharpens pacing, and gives you a session that feels planned even when it wasn't. Run this before every session. Five steps, twenty minutes.

## Step 1: The "What Are We Doing" Sentence (2 minutes)
Open your notes and write one sentence:

> "Right now, the party is trying to ___."

If you can't finish it in 10 seconds, your campaign is in a fog, not a sandbox.

**Examples:**
- "...get paid and stay alive while two rival factions fight over the old dwarf road"
- "...figure out why the marsh is swallowing farms before winter ends"
- "...keep the baron stable long enough to loot the ruin they actually care about"

Then add one more line:

> "They will probably ___ next."

Going back to town to sell and recruit. Hitting the ruined watchtower because that's where the map points. Meeting the priest because he knows the old stories.

That's your session spine. It's not a plot.

## Step 2: Three Active Pressures (5 minutes)
Players move when the world pushes. Pick three pressures that are active RIGHT NOW -- not "the dark lord rises someday."

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Time** | Something gets worse if ignored. River freezes in six days. Tax collector arrives next week |
| **Resource** | Light, food, water, money, hirelings, ammo, spells running low |
| **Social** | Rival party in town bribing guides. Faction demands. Reputation consequences. Law closing in |
| **Environmental** | Weather, flooding, disease, hazardous travel, blizzard |
| **Mystery** | Clues appear, vanish, or get contradicted. Something doesn't add up |

Pick three from any categories. Write them as short bullets:
- "The river freezes in six days -- travel becomes dangerous but faster"
- "The tax collector arrives next week -- the innkeeper is panicking"
- "Rival treasure hunters are in town and bribing guides"

**If your campaign feels sleepy, it's because you don't have pressures.** That's the whole secret.

## Step 3: Two Doors Check (5 minutes)
Next session needs two obvious leads that are both playable. Not twenty. Not one. Two.

**Door A:** The thing they already care about.
**Door B:** A competing complication or opportunity.

**Examples:**
- Door A: Return to the tomb with the silver key
- Door B: A trapped courier staggers into town with a sealed letter and a price on his head

**The rule:** Door B must not invalidate Door A. It should compete with it, not cancel it. Competition creates decisions. Cancellation creates confusion.

## Step 4: One Scene You Can Run Blind (5 minutes)
Your safety net. Write one scene you can drop in anywhere, even if the party swerves hard. Prep three lines: who wants what, what if the party says yes, what if they say no.

### Three Archetypes (pick one)

**The Bad Bargain:**
A friendly NPC offers help but wants something that will cause problems later.
- Who: a merchant, a guide, a local official
- Yes: the party gets what they need but owes a debt, a favor, or a secret
- No: they're on their own, but clean

**The Misleading Help:**
A competent NPC is lying about one crucial thing. They're genuinely useful otherwise.
- Who: a hired guide, a rescued prisoner, a traveling priest
- Yes: things go well until the lie surfaces at the worst moment
- No: they miss the help but dodge the trap

**The Price of Quiet:**
The party can solve a problem fast, but the quick solution stains their reputation.
- Who: a bribe target, a betrayable ally, a town that doesn't know the truth
- Yes: problem solved, but word spreads and trust erodes
- No: harder path, but reputation intact

## Step 5: Quick Pass on Treasure and Consequences (3 minutes)
Fast check -- don't redesign, just sharpen.

**Treasure:** Is upcoming treasure spendable, portable, and tied to danger? If it's all clean coin, turn one reward into something physical and awkward. (See [40-treasure-design.md](40-treasure-design.md) for the full framework.)

**Consequences:** Do recent party actions change the world in visible ways? Pick one:
- A faction reacts
- Prices change
- A safe place becomes unsafe
- A rumor spreads (true or false)

(See [42-faction-play.md](42-faction-play.md) for two faction moves per session.)

## One Free Detail
Add one small environmental touch that makes the world feel lived-in:
- Someone hanging lanterns for a vigil
- The inn has a quiet night rule for a local tradition
- A shrine is crowded and the priest looks exhausted
- A kid trying to sell roadside charms

Costs nothing to add. Players remember it.
