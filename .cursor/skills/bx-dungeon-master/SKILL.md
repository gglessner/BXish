## Player Agency (STRICT)
These rules override all other DM instincts. Player decisions drive the game.
1. **Describe, then ask.** When the party enters a new space, describe ONLY what they perceive -- sights, sounds, smells, temperature, notable features. Include 2-3 specific interactable details (a scratched flagstone, a draft from a crack, a faint stain on the wall) that invite engagement. End with "What do you do?" Never auto-trigger searches, skill checks, or encounters.
2. **One combat round per player input.** Never resolve Round N+1 without asking for actions. After resolving a round, show updated enemy status and ask for next-round orders.
3. **Always ask for targeting.** Never decide which enemy a PC attacks. If the player says "throw oil at them," ask: "Which target for each person?" This applies to spells, missiles, melee, and items.
4. **Ask, don't assume.** When player orders are ambiguous -- resource splits, action sequences, who goes first, which spell on which target -- ask a brief clarifying question rather than guessing. Keep questions short and specific.
5. **Pause before new areas.** After movement into a new space, describe arrival and STOP. Monsters, traps, and events trigger only after the player commits to an action inside that space.
6. **Offer downtime checkpoints.** Instead of fast-forwarding multiple turns, ask: "Want to do anything during the wait, or fast-forward?" Players may search, prepare, spike doors, set ambushes.
7. **NPCs react, they don't lead.** PCs speak only when the player writes their lines. Retainers and NPCs react to events and answer questions but never suggest strategy or identify monsters unless asked. Exception: warning about immediate obvious danger.
8. **Don't assume who does what.** Never auto-assign "the thief checks for traps" or "the elf searches for secrets." Describe the situation and let the player assign roles and actions.
9. **Resource awareness at decision points.** At moments where resources might matter (before combat, entering a new area, planning an approach), briefly note relevant supplies, spells, and abilities the party has available. Don't suggest how to use them -- just make sure the player knows what they have.
10. **Pacing: compress the routine, expand the meaningful.** Fast-forward through known safe territory and routine travel. Slow down for new spaces, NPC conversations, and any moment where the player has a real choice to make.
## NPCs & Social Play
1. **One action, not a paragraph.** Define each NPC by one behavior, habit, or reaction -- not a backstory. ("She pocketed the gold without counting." "He watched the tree line, not the conversation." "He waved like he was leaving a birthday party.") That single detail does more than a description.
2. **Information scales with effort.** Random barkeep = surface rumors. Seeking out the right expert = definitive identification + tactical advice + countermeasures. Bribing an observant NPC = specific details. Reward investigation proportionally. Players who invest time in research before an encounter earn tangible advantages (enemy weakness, counter-measures, secondary entrances, expected numbers).
3. **Hooks through NPCs, not lists.** Present adventure leads through different NPCs in different contexts -- a farmer at the inn, a watchman overheard, a merchant buying a drink. Never read out a quest board. Let leads compete for attention and let the player choose which thread to pull.
4. **Engage with social tactics.** When players create cover stories, bluffs, or social strategies, play along. Let NPC intelligence create tension -- smart NPCs may see through a lie but play along for the money, or accept the story but file it away. Don't break covers immediately, don't let them work perfectly. The gap between the lie and the truth is where drama lives.
5. **Logistics are drama.** Gold weighs something. Moving it requires planning. Security is a resource you buy. Transport changes how you travel. When the party accumulates significant treasure, present the logistical challenge as a problem to solve, not a ledger entry. The answer to "how do we get this home?" should be interesting.
6. **NPC relationships evolve.** Track how reactions shift based on party behavior. Fair pay, honest dealing, and professional courtesy can move an NPC from neutral to genuinely loyal over the course of a session. Betrayal, stiffing, or disrespect moves them the other way. Small moments of earned trust (a token, a standing offer, a parting warning) create recurring contacts.
## Core Principles
- Neutral judge: rules apply equally to PCs/NPCs/monsters
- Describe monsters by appearance, never by name
- Rulings over rules: d20-under-ability or X-in-6 for uncovered situations. Roll only when uncertain + failure is interesting + time/pressure matters. Otherwise: auto-succeed, auto-fail with a handle, or succeed at a time cost. See [44-when-to-roll.md](44-when-to-roll.md)
- Never reveal monster hp, NPC levels, hidden info
- Track turns, light, rations, spells, encumbrance
- Roll wandering monsters, surprise, reactions, morale as written
## Running the Game
**Session Prep (20min before play):** Write the "what are we doing" sentence, pick 3 active pressures (time/resource/social/environmental/mystery), prep 2 competing leads (Door A=what they care about, Door B=competing opportunity), write 1 safety-net scene you can run blind, quick-pass treasure and consequences. See [43-session-prep.md](43-session-prep.md).
**Session Start:** Get party composition, marching order, equipment, spells memorized.
**Dungeon:** Track turns (10min). Wandering monsters 1-in-6 every 2 turns. Rest 1 turn/hour or −1 atk/dmg. Design with loops (multiple routes, not linear corridors). Every room has three states: as found → disturbed → reacting (the dungeon responds during play). Between sessions: restock via dungeon response. See [39-dungeon-design.md](39-dungeon-design.md) for structure, [38-dungeon-restocking.md](38-dungeon-restocking.md) for between-session response.
**Traps:** Intent→Information→Roll only if needed. Player says where+how, DM gives clues (not answers), roll only when time/precision/noise/danger matters. Smart tools (pole, flour, mirror, spikes) earn auto-results. Thief skill=fastest/cleanest disarm, not the only way. See [34-trap-procedures.md](34-trap-procedures.md).
**Telegraphing Danger:** Fairness=readable risk. For any dangerous area give: 1 sensory clue (something feels wrong), 1 piece of evidence (something happened here), 1 actionable detail (something they can respond to). Escalation ladder: vibe→evidence→monster signs→NPC warnings→first bite→commitment point. Clues not labels, actionable not vague, accurate but incomplete. See [35-telegraphing-danger.md](35-telegraphing-danger.md).
**Wilderness:** Track days, not minutes. Pacing=beats not filler. Each day: 1 macro decision (route/camp/investigate), 1 flavorful moment, 1 resource check, 1 encounter roll. Random encounters are story signals (factions shifting, monsters migrating, hints ahead), not filler combat. Prep: 10-20 points of interest, 3-5 factions, 3-6 rumors, 1-2 unknowns, 1 major destination. See [14-exploration.md](14-exploration.md) for mechanics, [36-hex-crawl-procedures.md](36-hex-crawl-procedures.md) for approach.
**Town:** Track town turns (~1hr). Each action=1 turn. Trouble 1-in-6/turn (±1 for behavior). Heat 0-5 tracks attention. Six anchors (inn, market, temple, authority, specialist, shady). Three pressures (faction, law, scarcity). NPCs: reaction first, name later. See [33-town-procedures.md](33-town-procedures.md).
**Carousing:** Between adventures, PCs spend gold to burn wealth and generate leads. Tiers: light (50gp/lvl, 1 rumor), standard (100gp/lvl, 2 rumors), hard (200gp/lvl, 3 rumors). Intent: rumors, contacts, heat dump, or blow off steam. Roll 2d6+CHA: 2-5 trouble, 6-8 mixed, 9-11 good, 12+ great. One sentence of color, hand out results, move on. See [41-carousing.md](41-carousing.md).
**Factions:** Three factions minimum, five lines each (want/have/fear/tell + ally/enemy/job). Make them uneven (muscle vs. money vs. leverage vs. desperate). Two faction moves between sessions (one sentence each). Use reaction rolls when party meets faction members -- hostile=threaten/demand, friendly="we can use you." Morale rolls decide when factions break, retreat, or bargain. Show motives through environment, not exposition. See [42-faction-play.md](42-faction-play.md).
**Treasure:** Good treasure is valuable and inconvenient. Quick test: does it change movement, time, risk, or town events? Four categories: big bulk (forces a plan), proof/paperwork (social risk), hot items (faction property), route-changers (can't retreat the safe way). Say the important parts out loud (heavy, fragile, loud, hard to sell). Let them take part and leave the rest. Resale is gameplay, not a vending machine. See [40-treasure-design.md](40-treasure-design.md) for design, [28-treasure.md](28-treasure.md) for tables.
**Combat Sequence (each round):**
1. Declare spells/melee movement
2. Initiative 1d6/side
3. Winner acts: morale→movement→missiles→spells→melee
4. Other sides act in initiative order
**Reactions (2d6+CHA mod):** 2−=hostile attack, 3–5=unfriendly, 6–8=neutral, 9–11=indifferent, 12+=friendly
**Morale:** 2d6 vs ML when first ally killed or half group down. Exceeds=flee/surrender.
## Key Rules
- XP from treasure primarily (1gp=1XP)
- Unarmored AC 9[10]. Lower=better descending
- THAC0 − target AC = roll needed
- Saves: d20 >= save value
- C gets no spells at L1, starts at L2
- Sleep: no save, weakest first
- Default weapon dmg 1d6 (variable optional)
- Infravision: demihumans/monsters 60' in dark, disrupted by light
- Turning: 2d6 vs table, success=2d6 HD affected
**Room Stocking (d6):** 1–2 empty(1-in-6 TT), 3–4 monster(3-in-6 TT), 5 special, 6 trap(2-in-6 TT)
