# Dungeon Restocking

## Core Rules
A dungeon is an ecosystem. Two rules drive it:
1. **Empty space gets claimed**
2. **Survivors learn**

Don't reset the dungeon. Let it react.

## Two Questions When the Party Returns
1. **How long were they gone?** Not in minutes -- in useful chunks: a day, a week, long enough for word to spread.
2. **What did the party change?** Killed things, made noise, left bodies, lit fires, opened doors, took treasure, broke things, ran away from something.

Those two answers tell you what comes next.

## Time Brackets

| Time Away | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| Day or two | Survivors reorganize, get cautious |
| About a week | Someone new moves in, rival faction makes a play |
| Longer | Dungeon changes hands, story moves forward without the party |

Pick the bracket that feels right. No calendar system needed.

## Restocking Dial

| Level | Rooms Changed | Details |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Light** (fast return) | 1-2 | One sign of caution. Reduce loose treasure left behind |
| **Medium** (~week) | 3-5 | One new occupant, one blocked route or alarm. Main faction has a plan |
| **Heavy** (long gone) | Whole zone | New faction foothold. Boss situation shifted |

## Four-Part Framework (5 Minutes)
Don't restock room by room. Think **dungeon response.**

### 1. Survivors
What's left from the original population? How do they adapt?
- Relocate to defensible positions, choke points, places with sound advantage
- Set watches, avoid the kill zone where they got slaughtered
- Get jumpy -- might negotiate now because they're hurt

### 2. Intruders
Who moves into cleared space? Not necessarily a monster:
- Giant rats, vermin, ooze, spider nest
- Rival adventuring party
- Cult reclaiming ground
- Human scavengers
- A single nasty predator that sensed the corpses

### 3. Pressure
What new constraint shows up?
- More smoke (someone started cooking)
- Collapsed passageway (a support got burned)
- Blocked route, new locked door
- Patrol schedule
- Something that changes how the party moves

### 4. Scars
Evidence of the party's last trip. The dungeon remembers:
- Bodies (dragged, looted, or left where they fell)
- Burn marks, broken doors, chalk marks
- Smashed things, trails of spikes in a pit
- Their own spiked doors, still holding or pried open

## Pre-Session Checklist (8 Steps)
Run this right before play when the party is returning to a dungeon:

1. Pick time bracket (day / week / long)
2. Identify winners and losers (who got hurt? who gained territory?)
3. Choose **3 touch points** to update: one near entrance, one in cleared area, one near the frontier
4. Move survivors to defensible spots (choke points, cover, sound advantage)
5. Add **one cheap alarm or obstacle** (tripwire trash, bell, barred door, guard post, new lock)
6. Decide treasure status (see below)
7. Add **one non-combat complication** (smoke, stink, flooding, fungus, vermin, rival camp, new NPC scavenger)
8. Add **one clear sign the dungeon reacted** (fresh footprints, moved furniture, crude warning, new barricade, different smell, replaced door plank)

## Treasure Rules
Treasure doesn't blink out. It gets taken by whoever can take it.

| Treasure Type | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Loose + obvious + portable | Likely gone |
| Hidden or bulky | Likely still there, but harder to reach |
| Party left obvious signs they found it | Someone else found it too |
| Secrets with no evidence of discovery | Still secret |

**Don't take treasure away every time.** Sometimes leave it. Leaving it sometimes is what makes it believable when it's gone other times. If it's always gone, players stop engaging with logistics because they'll assume you'll delete the reward.

### "We'll Come Back With a Cart"
If the party left something big and valuable:

| Return Time | What Happened |
|-------------|--------------|
| Quick return | Still there, but survivors have eyes on it now |
| Week or so | **Moved deeper** (not vanished -- now a problem again), OR **partially stripped** (gems pried out, gold leaf peeled, easy value gone but heavy object remains), OR **someone else is working on it** (rival crew with ropes and sledges, goblins with a stupid plan) |
| Long gone | It's someone else's treasure now |

If the party says "that's not fair," the answer is simple: *it's not a bank vault. It's a dangerous hole in the ground full of living things and other greedy people.*

## Making It Feel Real
- **Use morale thinking.** Survivors might negotiate, flee sooner, set up an ambush and break when it fails. More believable than fighting to the last HP.
- **Let cleared areas become safe-ish.** The party earned a foothold. Reward it. Maybe that cleared room becomes their stash spot -- until somebody finds it.
- **Put new danger near old loot.** If the party left something valuable, that's where interest gathers. That's where dungeon pressure forms.
- **Show them their own past decisions.** Their chalk marks, their spiked doors, their burned webs. It makes the place feel persistent.

## What NOT to Do
- Don't refill every room (it's a ton of work and feels like a slot machine)
- Don't reset the dungeon like a video game level
- Don't remove all left-behind treasure (feels petty and punishing)
- Don't make cleared rooms pristine (someone dragged bodies, someone looted, someone burned torches)
- Don't think "room restock" -- think "dungeon response"
