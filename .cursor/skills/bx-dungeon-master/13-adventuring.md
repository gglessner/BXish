# Adventuring
## Party
Ideal 6-8 PCs. Set marching order. Caller=spokesperson. Mapper=1 player. Treasure: non-magic split even; magic roll dice, highest picks.
## Time & Weight
Turn=10min (6/hr). Round=10sec (60/turn). 10 coins=1lb. Max carry 1600cn. Party moves at slowest member.
## Encumbrance
**Treasure wt**: Coin/gem=1cn, jewellery=10, potion/wand=10, rod=20, staff=40, scroll=1.
**Basic (treasure only)**: Unarmoured 120'(40')/90'(30') w/treasure. Light 90'(30')/60'(20'). Heavy 60'(20')/30'(10').
**Detailed (all wt)**: Misc gear=80cn. ≤400cn→120'(40'), ≤600→90'(30'), ≤800→60'(20'), ≤1600→30'(10').
## Ability Checks
1d20≤ability=success. Mods: -4(easy) to +4(hard). Nat1=auto success, nat20=auto fail.
## Damage, Healing, Death
0hp=dead. Destructive spell/breath destroys gear. Magic items save using PC values. Natural healing: 1d3hp/day full rest. Magical healing: instant, stacks.
## Saving Throws
1d20≥save value=success. 5 categories: D(Death/Poison), W(Wands), P(Paralysis/Petrify), B(Breath), S(Spells/Rods/Staves).
PCs use class table by lvl; monsters use HD table. Success vs dmg=half; vs effect=negated. Failed poison=usually fatal.
## Hazards
**Climbing**: DEX check; sheer needs gear (Thieves exempt). **Light**: 30' radius. **Infravision**: 60', heat=bright, cool=grey; no reading; disrupted by light.
**Falling**: 1d6/10'. **Starvation**: -att/MV/hp. **Swimming**: half MV; all PCs swim. **Drowning**: by armour/load.
**Wandering monsters**: 1-in-6; noise increases, hiding decreases.
