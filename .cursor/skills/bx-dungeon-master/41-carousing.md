# Carousing -- Spend Gold, Get Rumors, Start Trouble

## Why Carouse?
B/X has no training rules. Gold piles up, town becomes a vending machine, and players have no pressure to spend. Carousing fixes that: it drains coins, kicks rumors into motion, and turns "we rest and resupply" into new leads, new enemies, new favors, and new trouble. Run the whole party in five minutes.

## The Procedure

### Step 1: Declare the Stake
Each PC decides independently how much to spend. Money is gone -- drinks, gambling, bribes, gifts, charity, buying rounds, paying for damages.

| Tier | Cost | Base Rumors |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Light** | 50gp per level | 1 |
| **Standard** | 100gp per level | 2 |
| **Hard** | 200gp per level | 3 |

### Step 2: Choose Intent
Each PC picks one. This determines what a good night produces.

| Intent | What It Gets on High Rolls |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Rumors** | More and better leads |
| **Contacts** | Meet useful people |
| **Heat dump** | Lay low, reduce tension, pay people not to look |
| **Blow off steam** | Chaos -- bigger boons but worse trouble |

Everyone gets base rumors from spending regardless of intent. Intent decides what you get on high rolls.

### Step 3: Roll 2d6 + CHA Modifier

| Roll | Band |
|------|------|
| 2-5 | **Trouble** |
| 6-8 | **Mixed** |
| 9-11 | **Good** |
| 12+ | **Great** |

### Step 4: Apply Results

**Trouble (2-5):**
Base rumors + roll on trouble table. If intent was heat dump, you may reroll trouble once but keep the second result. If intent was blow off steam, roll trouble twice -- DM picks the worse one.

**Mixed (6-8):**
Base rumors + minor complication: a brawl, nosy questions, property damage, reputation hit, owed favor, or a contact who wants something in return. You get what you came for, but with friction.

**Good (9-11):**
Base rumors + intent bonus:
- Rumors: one extra rumor, or upgrade one rumor with more detail
- Contacts: gain one useful contact
- Heat dump: reduce heat one step
- Blow off steam: small boon (free room for a week, tab forgiven, introduction to someone minor)

**Great (12+):**
Base rumors + enhanced intent bonus:
- Rumors: two extra rumors, or one extra with significant detail
- Contacts: one strong contact + a small boon
- Heat dump: reduce heat one step + gain a safe contact (can hide you, provide alibis, fence goods)
- Blow off steam: bigger boon (free room for a month, always drink free) -- never a magic item

## Optional: Carousing XP
Award 10% of gold spent as XP. Keeps it from becoming an XP farm but rewards engagement with town life.

## Rumor Table (Build Your Own)
d12 to d20, setting-specific. Every entry should be an adventure lead, not flavor text.

Example entries:
1. A merchant quietly buys odd coins from the old ruins. No questions asked
2. Someone's been paying for fresh graves
3. A guide went missing. His map is for sale if you find the right person
4. The old stone bridge sees trouble at sunset. It's not bandits
5. A temple assistant knows which noble is quietly hiring muscle
6. The well dried up the same week the sexton started locking the crypt
7. A farmer found worked stone under his field. He hasn't told anyone yet
8. There's a bounty on a creature nobody will describe out loud

Every rumor should point toward a place, a person, or a problem the party can act on.

## Trouble Table (Build Your Own)
d6 or d8. Trouble is not punishment -- it's another hook.

Example entries:
1. **Brawl** -- wake up bruised with a new enemy
2. **Lost purse** -- spent an extra 10% on top of your stake
3. **Public scene** -- famous for something stupid. -1 reaction rolls in town for a week
4. **Owed favor** -- a local fixer helped you out of a jam. They'll collect
5. **Property damage** -- it's going to cost extra to make this right
6. **Watch attention** -- pointed questions from the authorities. +1 heat

## Running Guidance
- **One sentence of color per result.** "You wake up with your holy symbol tied to a tankard handle." "You end the night playing dice with someone who never says their name." That's enough.
- **Don't make it a mini-campaign.** Carousing is a procedure, not a subplot. Declare, roll, one sentence, hand out results, move on.
- **Trouble is a hook, not a hard stop.** Rivals, complications, friction, crossed paths. It pushes the game forward, never blocks it.

## Where It Fits in the Adventure Loop
Drop carousing right after the PCs return to town:

1. Sell loot and tally treasure
2. Rest and recover
3. **Carouse** (if they want to -- never forced)
4. Hand out rumors (carousing generates the count)
5. Shopping, hireling recruitment
6. Depart

Carousing before the rumor drop is key because it generates how many rumors the party receives.

## Connections
- **Heat:** Ties to [33-town-procedures.md](33-town-procedures.md) heat track. Heat dump reduces it, trouble can increase it
- **Treasure:** Ties to [40-treasure-design.md](40-treasure-design.md). Gold finally has a purpose beyond the character sheet
- **Town:** Makes town feel like a place where things happen, not just a supply depot
