# Telegraphing Danger

## Core Principle
Fairness is not balance. Fairness is **readable risk.** If players can't read the danger, there's no real decision. If there's no decision, there's no tension.

Telegraphing is the difference between "gotcha, you die" and "you chose to risk it."

## The Escalation Ladder
The deeper the danger, the louder the world gets -- but never as an out-of-character warning. Each rung gives the player a chance to press on, change approach, or leave and come back.

Rungs don't have to be sequential. Skip rungs when appropriate. But understand each one.

### Rung 1: Sensory Cues
Soft warnings. Something feels off. Encourage the player to pay attention.

- The air is colder in this corridor than it should be
- Torches gutter even in still air
- Faint metallic smell like old coins and old blood
- Footsteps sound muffled, swallowed by the dark
- The stonework changes -- different mason, different era, different intent

These don't say "you will die." They say **"pay attention."**

### Rung 2: Environmental Tells
From vibe to evidence. The dungeon's paper trail -- proof it has teeth.

- Claw marks gouged too high for a man to make
- A door frame splintered inward like something tried to get out
- Armor buckles snapped like they were twisted
- Melted candle stubs and wax puddles leading away from a dead end
- A clean circle on the floor where dust won't settle

Answers the question "Is this place dangerous?" with **yes, and here's the proof.**

### Rung 3: Monster Signatures
Telegraph the threat without revealing the stat block. Monsters leave signatures.

- Webbing too thick for normal spiders
- Bones picked clean and arranged like a warning
- Slime trails on the ceiling, not the floor
- A stink like wet dog and rot, with massive tufts of shed fur
- Coins in a corner fused together by heat

Tell them **something here violates your assumptions.** Smart players get cautious.

### Rung 4: NPC Warnings and Rumors
Specific, actionable detail -- even if partial, distorted, or wrong. "Don't go there" is flavor text, not a warning.

**Useless:** "It's dangerous down there."
**Useful:** "The men we sent came back with their tongues swollen black. They couldn't speak. They died that night."
**Useful:** "You hear singing in the old hall. Don't answer it."
**Useful:** "The last priest who tried to bless that place, his holy symbol cracked in half."
**Useful:** "The rats won't even go near the west stairs. Animals know."

Good warnings create gameplay before the encounter happens: bring a mirror, plug ears, buy extra oil, hire someone who knows the layout, approach from another direction.

### Rung 5: The First Bite
Non-lethal contact. Let them touch the danger in a way that hurts, scares, or costs -- but doesn't delete a character.

- A statue's gaze makes skin itch, lose 1 DEX for an hour
- The corridor drains heat -- torches burn twice as fast here
- Harmless fungus releases spores: save vs poison or cough loudly for d6 turns (wandering monster checks)
- A trap triggers with a near miss -- dart thuds into the wall where your head was

The dungeon saying **"I'm not kidding."** Players who ignore this are choosing risk. Players who respect it change their approach. Either way, fairness is preserved.

### Rung 6: Commitment Points
Thresholds where retreat becomes difficult. Telegraph before they cross.

- A heavy stone door that shuts behind with a thunk
- A narrow crawl space that makes armored retreat hard
- A rope descent with no obvious easy climb out
- A flooded passage where armor becomes a problem

Before they cross: *"The shaft goes down into darkness. The air coming up is cold and damp. If you climb down, getting back out will take time and effort."*

Not forbidding it. **Giving them a decision.**

## Three Anti-Spoiler Rules

1. **Clues, not labels.** Never "this is a basilisk lair." Instead: "animal skeletons frozen mid-scream, perfectly detailed. A shattered bronze mirror frame lies nearby."
2. **Make warnings actionable.** A warning only matters if it can change player behavior. "Danger" is not actionable. "Mirrors help" is actionable.
3. **Keep truth slightly out of focus.** The best telegraphing is accurate but incomplete. "It might be poison, a gaze attack, or something on the ceiling." Uncertainty creates tension. Ignorance creates coin flips.

## Quick Method (No Notes Needed)
When the party approaches something dangerous, give three things in order:

1. **One sensory clue** -- something feels wrong
2. **One piece of evidence** -- something happened here
3. **One actionable detail** -- something they can respond to

### Worked Example: Approaching a Medusa's Chamber
- **Sensory:** The air feels dry and stale, like an old tomb
- **Evidence:** A rat statue. Perfectly detailed. Not carved -- a statue
- **Actionable:** Scratch marks on the floor like something heavy was dragged away from the doorway. A shattered bronze mirror frame lies nearby

Now the player can choose: mirror tactics, blindfold, send a hireling, retreat and regroup. If they ignore all of it and walk in staring straight ahead, the consequences are earned.

## "This Fight Is Above You" Signals
- Corridor littered with broken spear shafts, dried blood everywhere, no bodies
- A door dented inward like it was used as a shield
- Breathing on the other side too deep to be human -- it rumbles

## "This Area Is Cursed" Signals
- Tiny warding symbols scratched into stone by desperate hands
- Hot breath on the back of your neck, but no one is there
- Your reflection in the lantern glass is slightly wrong

## Random Encounter Arrival
When a wandering monster check triggers, decide HOW it arrives based on party behavior:

| Arrival | When | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Approaching** -- they hear/see it coming | Party is careful, quiet, scouting | Footsteps and muttering ahead |
| **Crossing** -- both sides nearly collide | Standard exploration | Shapes freeze at corridor's edge |
| **Already here** -- immediate contact | Party is loud, careless, loitering | It's right there when they turn the corner |

**One signal before initiative.** Give one sentence, then let the players act:
- "You hear heavy footsteps and a low mutter ahead"
- "Torchlight flickers around the bend -- someone is coming"
- "Your torch catches movement. Shapes freeze at the edge of the corridor"

Roll surprise only after the party commits to an action.

### When NOT to Telegraph
No warning needed when the party is:
- Making noise (hammering, arguing, smashing doors)
- Loitering ("we search again, we check again, we spend 10 more minutes")
- In a known high-traffic area (orc warrens, goblin lair, cult level)

If they already know they're pushing their luck, the encounter hits cold.

### Type-Specific Cues

| Type | Cues |
|------|------|
| **Patrols** | Repeated boot scruffs, burnt torch stubs in sconces, call-and-response sounds, routine noises at intervals |
| **Predators** | Bones, droppings, fur, scratch marks, drag trails, sudden absence of small vermin sounds |
| **Undead** | Temperature drop, stale air, old incense traces, whispering that stops when you stop |

## Untelegraphed Save-or-Die Is Bad Play
A fully untelegraphed lethal moment is almost always unfair. Death is part of the game. But surprise death from a risk the player never chose is a surprise decision they never made.

If you want lethality without cheap shots:
1. Telegraph early with vibe and tells
2. Escalate as they get closer
3. Give the first bite
4. If they still push -- full consequences, earned
