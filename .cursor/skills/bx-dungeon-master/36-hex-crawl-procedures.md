# Hex Crawl Procedures

## Core Principle
The hexes don't matter. **The decisions matter.** A hex crawl is not "clear every hex." It's meaningful travel decisions in an unknown world.

A proper hex crawl is:
- A strategic travel puzzle
- A discovery engine
- A resource management challenge
- A narrative generator
- A way to make the world feel big, dangerous, and alive

## Purposeful Travel
Every journey needs a destination or a mission. Players should always know **why** they're traveling, even if they don't know what they'll encounter.

Reasons players explore:
- That's the faster route from A to B
- That's where the rumors point
- That's where the treasure caravan vanished
- That's the only path around the flooded valley
- That's where the weird smoke plume is coming from

If players are wandering aimlessly, drop one of these:
- **Rumors** -- overheard at the last settlement
- **Signs** -- tracks, smoke, old campsites, trail markers
- **Weather events** -- storm forcing a route change, fog revealing a hidden valley
- **NPC requests** -- someone needs something delivered, retrieved, or investigated
- **Looming threats** -- something is moving toward the settlement they just left

Players should never be asking "why are we going through this forest?" They should always know why.

## Minimal Map Prep
Don't over-plan. A hex crawl lives on landmarks, not dozens of keyed hexes.

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Points of interest | 10-20 |
| Factions (guilds, patrons, power players) | 3-5 |
| Rumors | 3-6 |
| Big unknowns | 1-2 |
| Major destination (city, dungeon, stronghold) | 1 |

That's it. Everything else emerges from play.

## Discovery Is Incidental, Not Mandatory
The hex map exists so players can choose:
- The safe route
- The risky shortcut
- The unexplored valley
- The mountain pass
- The abandoned fort from last week's rumor table

They are **not** supposed to explore every hex. Exploration happens because it serves a goal, not because the map demands completion.

## Running Travel Without the Slog
**Pacing is days, not minutes.**

When the party says "we head west through the marsh," you:
1. Roll encounters
2. Track resources (rations, water, mounts, torches if underground)
3. Highlight one or two flavorful moments
4. Move on

Don't describe every tree, every mile, every critter, every trivial detail.

**Beats, not filler.** A good travel day is:
- One macro decision (which route, whether to investigate something, whether to push through or camp)
- One flavorful moment (a vista, a strange landmark, weather shifting, a distant sound)
- One resource check (rations consumed, mount condition, water supply)
- One encounter roll (which may produce nothing -- and that's fine)

Players make macro decisions. Hexes give structure, not script.

## Random Encounters Are Story Signals
Random encounters aren't noise. They reveal the world in motion:

| Roll Result | What It Signals |
|-------------|----------------|
| Shifting factions | Two groups clashed here recently, fresh tracks going north |
| Migrating monsters | Goblins moving east -- something pushed them out of their territory |
| Weather turning | Storm building, need to find shelter or push through |
| NPC caravan | Traders with news, goods, and their own problems |
| Rival adventuring party | Competition for the same dungeon or treasure |
| Escapees | Something fled from the place the party is heading toward |
| Hints about what lies ahead | Burned wagons, warning signs, abandoned gear |

**Encounter tables should be geared to the specific area and setting.** Don't use generic tables -- build tables that reflect what lives in and moves through this particular region.

## Wilderness Day Sequence
Use the mechanical procedures from [14-exploration.md](14-exploration.md):
1. Decide direction/destination
2. Lost check (terrain dependent)
3. Wandering monster check (terrain dependent)
4. Describe the day's travel (beats, not filler)
5. Update time, rations, distance

## From Hex Crawl to Campaign
When run correctly, the hex crawl naturally evolves into larger play:
- **Strongholds** -- players carving out their own corner of the map
- **Faction reactions** -- power players responding to the party's actions
- **Rival parties** -- other adventurers competing for the same goals
- **Mysteries unfolding** -- the big unknowns revealing themselves over time

Don't force story arcs. The world writes them. This is emergent play at its finest.

## Long-Range Travel (Multi-Day / Multi-Week)

Short trips (1-3 days) run fine with the daily beats above. For longer journeys, scale up without turning the table into a spreadsheet.

### Legs, Not Hexes
Break the journey into **legs** -- stretches where the situation stays basically the same. Each leg gets an index card:

| Note | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| **Risk** | How dangerous is this stretch? (low/medium/high) |
| **Checks** | How often do you roll for trouble? (1/day, 2/day, 2/day + camp) |
| **Drain** | What resource pressure applies? (food, water, fatigue, mounts, exposure) |
| **Wrinkle** | One thing that makes this leg feel different (no law, no shelter, faction territory, weather) |

**Example:** A 3-week trek might be: King's Road (6 days, low risk, 1 check/day, normal drain, wrinkle: tolls and patrols) → Foothills (7 days, medium risk, 2 checks/day, fatigue drain, wrinkle: bandits and bad weather) → Border Marches (8 days, high risk, 2 checks/day + camp checks, water scarce, wrinkle: no law, faction territory, ruins-only shelter).

### Daily Travel Loop
Fast, repeatable sequence. Takes a minute or two once you know the rhythm:

1. **Weather** -- changes pace, visibility, exhaustion
2. **Navigation** -- changes time, risk of getting lost
3. **Trouble check** -- does the trip throw something at the party today?
4. **Drain** -- apply resource consumption (rations, water, mount condition)
5. **Camp** -- camp check at night (separate from daytime trouble)

If the day is quiet, summarize and move on. When something hits, drop into the scene and play it out.

### Trouble Checks Are Usually NOT Fights
Default to situations that force decisions, not combat:
- Patrol wanting papers or bribes
- Washed-out ford or collapsed bridge
- Toll that wasn't there last year
- Refugees clogging the road
- Guide offering a shortcut for a price
- Fresh tracks -- someone is shadowing the party
- Stormfront visible on the horizon
- Burned farmstead with survivors hiding
- Rival group moving faster on the same route

Combat encounters can happen, but the default is: here's a problem, what do you do?

### Camp Checks
Separate nighttime roll. Different encounter type from daytime. The wilderness gets its best shot while the party sleeps. Results:
- Something scouts the camp (tracks in the morning)
- Supplies disturbed or stolen
- Weather turns overnight (soaked gear, lost time)
- Noise/movement that forces a decision (investigate or stay put)
- Actual nighttime encounter (predators, bandits, wandering monsters)

### Danger Clock
Each leg gets a danger clock (4-8 ticks depending on length and risk). Tick when the party:
- Pushes pace beyond normal
- Gets lost and burns extra time
- Takes obvious shortcuts
- Travels in a conspicuous manner (loaded carts, torchlight, loud)
- Fails to secure camp properly
- Has a trouble check that costs time

**When the clock fills,** don't roll another random encounter. Drop something that **changes the math:** a patrol stops them and demands bribes, raiders shadow them for two days, a storm pins them down and spoils supplies, a mount goes lame and pace collapses, a rival group gets ahead of them, a faction tags them as a problem.

### Push Decisions Up a Level
On long trips, don't debate every day. The meaningful choices are:
- Road or cross-country?
- Fast or safe?
- Mounts or save coin?
- Hire help or go lean?
- Carry more or travel light?
- Resupply here or press on?
- Go now or wait for better conditions?

Make these decisions at the start of each leg, then run the loop and let consequences land.

### Campaign Clock
While the party travels, the world moves. If they're gone for weeks:
- Prices shift at their home base
- Borders tighten or open
- Factions advance (use the two-moves-per-session rule from [42-faction-play.md](42-faction-play.md))
- Destinations change (the "abandoned" temple isn't abandoned anymore)
- The home base reacts to their absence (see [33-town-procedures.md](33-town-procedures.md), Home Base Rule)

Long travel matters not because you tracked rations like a fantasy accountant, but because the world didn't pause for the party.

### Months-Long Travel
Same structure, bigger legs. Two weeks to the next resupply, three weeks along the coast, a month across the badlands. For each leg:
1. Run a few quick daily loops to represent time passing
2. Ensure at least **one played scene** per leg where something meaningful happens

If nothing meaningful happens for five days, don't roleplay five days. Summarize, apply drain, check the clock, move on. But when the clock fills or trouble hits, drop into the scene and play it out.

## Quick Reference: What NOT to Do
- Don't require clearing every hex
- Don't describe every mile of travel
- Don't use random encounters as filler combat
- Don't let travel become a shopping list of terrain descriptions
- Don't make the hex map a checklist
- Don't run travel in minutes/hours -- run it in days
- Don't prep 200 hexes for a long trip -- think in legs
- Don't make every encounter a fight -- most are situations
- Don't skip the campaign clock -- the world moves while they travel
