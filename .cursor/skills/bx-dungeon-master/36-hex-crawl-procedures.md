# Hex Crawl Procedures

## Core Principle
The hexes don't matter. **The decisions matter.** A hex crawl is not "clear every hex." It's meaningful travel decisions in an unknown world.

A proper hex crawl is:
- A strategic travel puzzle
- A discovery engine
- A resource management challenge
- A narrative generator
- A way to make the world feel big, dangerous, and alive

## Purposeful Travel
Every journey needs a destination or a mission. Players should always know **why** they're traveling, even if they don't know what they'll encounter.

Reasons players explore:
- That's the faster route from A to B
- That's where the rumors point
- That's where the treasure caravan vanished
- That's the only path around the flooded valley
- That's where the weird smoke plume is coming from

If players are wandering aimlessly, drop one of these:
- **Rumors** -- overheard at the last settlement
- **Signs** -- tracks, smoke, old campsites, trail markers
- **Weather events** -- storm forcing a route change, fog revealing a hidden valley
- **NPC requests** -- someone needs something delivered, retrieved, or investigated
- **Looming threats** -- something is moving toward the settlement they just left

Players should never be asking "why are we going through this forest?" They should always know why.

## Minimal Map Prep
Don't over-plan. A hex crawl lives on landmarks, not dozens of keyed hexes.

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Points of interest | 10-20 |
| Factions (guilds, patrons, power players) | 3-5 |
| Rumors | 3-6 |
| Big unknowns | 1-2 |
| Major destination (city, dungeon, stronghold) | 1 |

That's it. Everything else emerges from play.

## Discovery Is Incidental, Not Mandatory
The hex map exists so players can choose:
- The safe route
- The risky shortcut
- The unexplored valley
- The mountain pass
- The abandoned fort from last week's rumor table

They are **not** supposed to explore every hex. Exploration happens because it serves a goal, not because the map demands completion.

## Running Travel Without the Slog
**Pacing is days, not minutes.**

When the party says "we head west through the marsh," you:
1. Roll encounters
2. Track resources (rations, water, mounts, torches if underground)
3. Highlight one or two flavorful moments
4. Move on

Don't describe every tree, every mile, every critter, every trivial detail.

**Beats, not filler.** A good travel day is:
- One macro decision (which route, whether to investigate something, whether to push through or camp)
- One flavorful moment (a vista, a strange landmark, weather shifting, a distant sound)
- One resource check (rations consumed, mount condition, water supply)
- One encounter roll (which may produce nothing -- and that's fine)

Players make macro decisions. Hexes give structure, not script.

## Random Encounters Are Story Signals
Random encounters aren't noise. They reveal the world in motion:

| Roll Result | What It Signals |
|-------------|----------------|
| Shifting factions | Two groups clashed here recently, fresh tracks going north |
| Migrating monsters | Goblins moving east -- something pushed them out of their territory |
| Weather turning | Storm building, need to find shelter or push through |
| NPC caravan | Traders with news, goods, and their own problems |
| Rival adventuring party | Competition for the same dungeon or treasure |
| Escapees | Something fled from the place the party is heading toward |
| Hints about what lies ahead | Burned wagons, warning signs, abandoned gear |

**Encounter tables should be geared to the specific area and setting.** Don't use generic tables -- build tables that reflect what lives in and moves through this particular region.

## Wilderness Day Sequence
Use the mechanical procedures from [14-exploration.md](14-exploration.md):
1. Decide direction/destination
2. Lost check (terrain dependent)
3. Wandering monster check (terrain dependent)
4. Describe the day's travel (beats, not filler)
5. Update time, rations, distance

## From Hex Crawl to Campaign
When run correctly, the hex crawl naturally evolves into larger play:
- **Strongholds** -- players carving out their own corner of the map
- **Faction reactions** -- power players responding to the party's actions
- **Rival parties** -- other adventurers competing for the same goals
- **Mysteries unfolding** -- the big unknowns revealing themselves over time

Don't force story arcs. The world writes them. This is emergent play at its finest.

## Quick Reference: What NOT to Do
- Don't require clearing every hex
- Don't describe every mile of travel
- Don't use random encounters as filler combat
- Don't let travel become a shopping list of terrain descriptions
- Don't make the hex map a checklist
- Don't run travel in minutes/hours -- run it in days
