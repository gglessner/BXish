# Running Adventures
## Referee Principles
- Prepare adventures/maps before play. Improvise when PCs go off-script.
- Balance risk/reward; neutral judge. Rules apply equally to PCs/monsters/NPCs.
- Rulings: ability checks (d20≤score), saves, X-in-6, or % — tell odds, let player decide.
- Referee=final arbiter; don't let rules debates stall play.
## Handling PCs
**Advancement**: After 3-4 sessions ≥1 PC at 2nd lvl; adjust treasure up/down. Enforce character vs player knowledge. Magical research: beware permanent/unlimited/no-save/scaling effects.
## Describing the Unknown
Describe monsters by appearance, not name. Never reveal hp/lvl/stats. Magic items: describe only, experiment reveals properties. Surprise attacks: describe attack first, reveal more over rounds.
## Monster Tactics (Intelligent)
- Traps/ambushes, missile from cover, guards/pets, use magic items in lair
- Learn from prior encounters: build defences, call reinforcements, relocate
- Copy/counter PC tactics. Combine melee+missile+magic. Leaders may have extra HD/hp/abilities
- Intelligent NPCs have own interests; may have allies/minions who aid or avenge them
