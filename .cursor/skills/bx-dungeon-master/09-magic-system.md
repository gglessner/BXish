# Magic System

## Memorization & Casting
- Full night sleep + 1hr study/prayer to memorize all slots
- Same spell memorizable multiple times if multiple slots of that level
- Cast = erased from memory. Requires speech + free hands. Target must be visible unless stated
- Concentration: any action or being attacked breaks it
- Multiple spells can't boost same ability; different abilities stack. Spells + magic items stack

## Arcane Magic (Magic-Users, Elves)
- Memorize from **spell books** — must have book at hand, limited to spells in book
- Reversible: choose normal or reversed at **memorization** time
- Starting spells: as many as can memorize; referee chooses or lets player
- Adding spells: mentor (1 week, referee picks) or magical research
- Lost book: rewrite 1,000gp + 1 week per spell level
- Captured books: only owner can read without magic

## Divine Magic (Clerics)
- Memorize via **prayer** — may choose any spell from class list
- Reversible: choose normal or reversed at **casting** time
- Deity disfavour for violating alignment tenets: –1 atk, reduced spells, perilous quest required
- Alignment & reversals: Lawful=reversed only in dire need, Chaotic=usually reversed, Neutral=per deity

## Magical Research
- **15% minimum failure** on all research. Failed = money + time lost
- **New spells:** 2 weeks + 1,000gp/spell level. Must already cast that level
- **Magic items (spell effect):** 1 week + 500gp/spell level × number of uses. Often needs rare components
- **Magic items (other):** 10,000–100,000gp, 1mo–1yr. Examples: 20 arrows+1=10k/1mo, plate+1=10k/6mo, crystal ball=30k/6mo, ring x-ray=100k/1yr
- Divine casters: only items they can use. Arcane: any except divine-only
